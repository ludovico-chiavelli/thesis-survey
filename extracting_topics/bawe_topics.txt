3. George is a prisoner in a high security prison. As Part of the prison regulations, prison officers are permitted to search all prisoners before they are returned to their cells. George refused to comply with the search arrangements. He claims that the searches are too degrading and are unnecessary as there is no threat to the security of the prison. He feels intimidated by the searches and feels that the policy is unfair when applied to every prisoner rather than where there is a specific reason to justify such searches. George is charged with an offence against prison discipline as it is alleged that he disobeyed a lawful order as part of the disciplinary code. The charges were heard by the Prison's Deputy Governor appointed by the Governor to hear disciplinary charges against prisoners. The Deputy Governor was also responsible for implementing searches and was present when George refused to comply with the search. George was found guilty of a breach of the rules of prison discipline. Advise George on the grounds of any judicial review to challenge the conviction. Consider how the rules of natural justice might be applied to George.
