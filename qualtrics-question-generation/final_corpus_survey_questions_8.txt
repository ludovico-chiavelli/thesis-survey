While Ross advocates for a universal moral framework encompassing distinct prima facie duties, Dancy contends that these general duties are insufficient in capturing the complexity of real-world moral dilemmas.

Dancy's primary criticism of Ross's deontology stems from the inherent tension between universal duties and their practical applications. Ross outlines several..."
