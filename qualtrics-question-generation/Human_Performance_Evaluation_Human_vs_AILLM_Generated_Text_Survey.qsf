The expected outcome of this research is a list of features that can be applied to creating a detection software that can automatically determine if text is human or LLM generated.

If you think something is LLM generated, I will ask you to also explain why and how you would make it sound more human like by suggesting some edits. The survey is conducted online and you can complete it in a location and on a device of your choosing (I recommend a laptop, desktop or tablet with a keyboard). If you wish, you may withdraw from this survey at any point by simply closing the survey and leaving it unsubmitted.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>RISKS <\/strong><br \/>\nThe topics for the pool of texts have been chosen from English-learner tasks and academic essays. As such, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any topics that are deemed harmful to the majority of the public. To mitigate the chances of potentially sensitive texts appearing in the survey I will perform an automated check with an established wordlist of all the texts and delete texts on sensitive topics such as sex, sexual-orientation, race, religion etc.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>DATA MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE<\/strong><br \/>\nData will managed in line with all relevant University policies including the Data Protection Policy, Information Security Policy, and Research Data Management Policy and Guidance. Data will be stored in appropriately anonymised format on a University of Aberdeen repository and on the Qualtrics survey platform.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>CONFIDENTIALITY AND ANONYMITY<\/strong><br \/>\nThe University&rsquo;s Privacy Notice for Research Participants is available at https:\/\/www.abdn.ac.uk\/about\/privacy\/research-participants-938.php<br \/>\nRaw data and the identity of participants will not be released to anyone outside the research team. The data you provide will be analysed and may be used in publications, dissertations, reports or presentations derived from the research project, but this will be done in such a way that your identity is not disclosed.&nbsp; The data will be stored anonymously &ndash; that is, your name won&rsquo;t be recorded and thus your responses cannot be traced back your identity.

You&rsquo;re probably already familiar with LLMs, as you might&rsquo;ve used OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT or Google&rsquo;s Gemini. The expected outcome of this research is a list of features that can be applied to creating a detection software that can automatically determine if text is human or LLM generated. This research is being conducted as part of my master&rsquo;s thesis.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>WHO CAN TAKE PART <\/strong><br \/>\nAny person of the age of 18 and above can participate in this research.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>WHAT YOU WILL BE ASKED TO DO <\/strong><br \/>\nIn this survey, you will be presented with some text and will have to determine whether it is human or LLM generated. If you think something is LLM generated, I will ask you to also explain why and how you would make it sound more human like by suggesting some edits. The survey is conducted online and you can complete it in a location and on a device of your choosing (I recommend a laptop, desktop or tablet with a keyboard). If you wish, you may withdraw from this survey at any point by simply closing the survey and leaving it unsubmitted.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>RISKS <\/strong><br \/>\nThe topics for the pool of texts have been chosen from English-learner tasks and academic essays. As such, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any topics that are deemed harmful to the majority of the public. To mitigate the chances of potentially sensitive texts appearing in the survey I will perform an automated check with an established wordlist of all the texts and delete texts on sensitive topics such as sex, sexual-orientation, race, religion etc.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>DATA MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE<\/strong><br \/>\nData will managed in line with all relevant University policies including the Data Protection Policy, Information Security Policy, and Research Data Management Policy and Guidance.
