"It's about providing constructive criticism in a way that is helpful, respectful, and focused on improvement. First, remember to be specific. Instead of saying "Your presentation was good," try saying "I really liked how you used visual aids to illustrate your points. It made the information easier to understand." Next, be timely. Feedback is most effective when it's given soon after the event or task. This helps the colleague remember the situation and makes the feedback more relevant.

Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein*..."
