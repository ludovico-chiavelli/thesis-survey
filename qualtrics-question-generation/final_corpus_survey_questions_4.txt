However, after completing the course and engaging with various texts and debates, I have developed a different perspective.

This is because our experiences, understanding, and perception of reality are all subjective. It..."

"In George Orwell's classic dystopian novel 1984, the totalitarian regime exercises control over language as a means of exerting power over the population.
