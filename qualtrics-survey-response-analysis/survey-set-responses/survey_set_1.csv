""I"" is used, which is atypical of an LLM.
The suggestion of helping a ""friend"" should immediately suggest it was written by a Human. As LLMs typically don't claim to have friends. On another occasion, the text refers to beliefs which is another concept generally favouring the author being Human.
The text also overuses conjunctions, suggesting a Human of limited vocabulary wrote this.
",,2 - Likely AI,"The written text is hard to critique.
The vocabulary, punctuation, and grammar are superior.
However, the structure of the text raises eyebrows to the possibility of LLM involvement. 
LLMs very frequently give short summaries of topics before entering into a body of text. 
The text reads very ""matter-of-factly"" whilst remaining rather non-committed to the arguments it explores: ""decentralisation can be seen..."" the usage of this kind of language does seem like a large compression/summary of a whole argument, that is typical with LLM responses. It ""tries"" its hardest to remain unbiased while reporting all of the facts. Which just isn't very likely for a human to be able to do.","Decentralisation is a process of transferring power, authority or resources from a central body to local/distributed bodies. This essay will explore the concept of decentralisation, its positive aspects, as well as potential risks and negative consequences. 
Decentralisation arises from dissatisfaction with the traditional top-down approach to governance. Before decentralisation - a central government or institution holds all of the power and makes decisions on behalf of the people.

LLMs love to use comparative language. It also tends to repeat itself. ""I would like to compare... to show similarities and differences"". the second party of this quote isn't particularly necessary.
There is also a high reliance on the words ""However"", and ""whereas"". The LLM will continually bring up contrasting points in order to remain unbiased.

As for Text 1: I believe this to be a Human written piece. It is very difficult to read, little care has been taken to make it parse for the reader. LLMs typically produce readable texts.
Another point for consideration: LLMs don't typically quote facts and figures to the extent that this author has. Due to their inability to understand and consider the meaning behind data.","I will be comparing the young and the old in reference to technology usage.
Both groups use technology extensively in order to communicate.

Whereas in text 2, the piece is clearly opinionated (human).
