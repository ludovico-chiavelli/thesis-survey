The suggestion of helping a ""friend"" should immediately suggest it was written by a Human. As LLMs typically don't claim to have friends. On another occasion, the text refers to beliefs which is another concept generally favouring the author being Human.
The text also overuses conjunctions, suggesting a Human of limited vocabulary wrote this.

The vocabulary, punctuation, and grammar are superior.

LLMs love to use comparative language. It also tends to repeat itself. ""I would like to compare... to show similarities and differences"". the second party of this quote isn't particularly necessary.
There is also a high reliance on the words ""However"", and ""whereas"". The LLM will continually bring up contrasting points in order to remain unbiased.

As for Text 1: I believe this to be a Human written piece. It is very difficult to read, little care has been taken to make it parse for the reader. LLMs typically produce readable texts.
Another point for consideration: LLMs don't typically quote facts and figures to the extent that this author has. Due to their inability to understand and consider the meaning behind data.","I will be comparing the young and the old in reference to technology usage.
