As a student, at the beginning of my course, I believed that social reality is created by society through a combination of collective beliefs and actions. However, after completing the course and engaging with various texts and debates, I have developed a different perspective.
I now believe that social reality is constructed by individuals, and their individual actions and interactions. This is because our experiences, understanding, and perception of reality are all subjective. It is through these interactions and experiences that our social reality is formed. For example, how people interact with each other in a particular social setting or how they perceive a particular event or issue.
This change in my view has been persuaded by several factors. Firstly, the idea that social reality is a product of human interaction and interpretation is supported by sociologists like Peter",BAWE,llama,human,0.5,model

Consider the ways in which Orwell articulates the relationship between power and language in at least two texts","In George Orwell's classic dystopian novel 1984, the totalitarian regime exercises control over language as a means of exerting power over the population. As the protagonist Winston Smith observes, 'The English language was coming under a deadly attack. In its place [the regime] was fostering a debased form of Russian, a kind of pidgin English, easy to learn and not very expressive' (Orwell, 1949, p. 22). Orwell illustrates that language is not merely a reflection of relationships of power, but rather a tool used by those in power to shape perceptions, suppress dissent and maintain their control over society. The ways in which language is used and manipulated in 1984 demonstrate the ways in which power is exercised, exchanged, extended and realised.
