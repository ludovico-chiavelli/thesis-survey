The first and famous, one thing I can do is look at the structure of a word and see if there are any other words ""inside"" the word that I recognise. For example, the word ""inhabitant"". What words can I see inside this word? I have ""In"" and ""habitat"". Here, I'm using two words in a sentence to halp me remember the new word. The second, I use rhymes to help me remember words and also longer phrases or tracts of text. For example, word ""neck"" and word ""snake"".I always remember snake is locating arround neck over shoulders. Or phrase ""How much do you charge"". It is funny sound, isn't it? The third, I like to remember interesting word combinations. "" I tend to stick"". I have just learned this word combination a few hours ago.

My second advice to you, Its about decrease the number of time that you go out with your friends and when you go out, you could go at cheaper places. You could make dinner at home and call yours friend for dinner and in this case is right you divide the costs with yours friends. It would be cheaper to everyone.

Her father, on the other hand, tried to encourage her intellectual curiosity. Frida's paintings show the influence of the Mexican Revolution on life in Mexico. In addition, many of her works illustrate her own experience of tragedy and pain. Frida was famous for her uncompromising portrayals of female sexuality. furthermore, she was known for having passionate affairs with both men and women. In 1939, Andre Breton arranged for Frida to exhibit her painting in Paris. However, when she arrived, Breton had made no preparations for the exhibition, and it was only with the help of French surrealist Marcel Duchamp that the exhibition took place. It was not a great success. Europeans were preparing for the Second World War, and moreover, Frida found their attitude to her art patronizing. Kahle was traumatized by her divorce from Diego, and painted the Two Friday (1939) in which she paints two versions of herself, one with a healthy heart and one with a broken heart. nonetheless, she felt strong enough to move on and to start taking care of herself. whereas Frida was known mainly as Diego Rivera's wife during her lifetime, nowadays she is known mainly for her incredible paintings, and for being a feminist icon.",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

I have thought seriously in regard from your last email. incidentally if you mind me so saying, thank you to give me the high opportunity in order to retrieve this exciting work. predominantly, I set up a few ideas to develop in concern the game's cards. At first, every child should sending to us a letter with three dollars and their best ways for saving the endangered species from extinction. Of course, all the money will be given into a foundation for the protection of the wild animals.These best ideas would be rewarded with a travel in Africa about the first place and a ticket for a natural reserve about the second. After that, these blurbs will be published into our magazine. In addition, it seems that we can improve greatly the informations on the cards about species. The swift speed, the number remaining, when we found them and why they're becoming rare. finally, I've chosen others interesting animals whom we getting the copyright . A crash of elephants or rhinoceros, then a herd of giraffes. Yours faithfully.",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English. You are currently at B1 level.

I propose to sort the animals after the categories extinct, critically endangered and vulnerable. The terms of these categories must be checked. I would propose to sort the different animals by an international organisation. Copyright: We already have some copyrights. But, we dont have the copyrights for all the photos we like to use. Do we have a budget for this matter? anyway, Im looking for photos out of copyright. names: I would propose simple card play like happy family. I like also the idea of a family quiz in form of a game of dice. On a world map there are animal stations, where the children have to answer a question to an animal or its habitat. editor: We need an editor. How about me? I like to do it. It would be my first time. I have lots of experience from the African set and animals of the Americas. Meeting? Can we meet us next week?

John Smith,How are you?Im writing in way to discuss about the cards that we are selling.During the weekend, I had an idea meanwhile I was watching a TV show about the recent increase of the number of tree huggers in the last years. It seems that everyone is an environment defender nowadays.We can use this to increase our sales creating a playing card with endangered and extinct animals. My main idea is creating a TOP TRUMPS game card with categories of animals: extinct, critically endangered, vulnerable, etc.We already have the copyrights for the photos of the animals, except the Dody, but we can find a picture out of copyright. This Dody photo cant be missing, anyhow did you ever hear the expression: head as a Dody?I could be the editor.

When we will touch the public we must use more marketing technic. We must focus more attention to the danger of extension of animals. On the card we must be more pedagogic about the cause of the disaster. On the one hand a photo with the animal in that natural habitat and on the other hand a photo with the animal in a destroy habitat. I think about an oil spill. Remember everyone is interested in environment these days. We must choose the good animal. The best is an amazing animal as the dodo. We should make some jokes about this animal. We must show the pleasure that this animals give to the children. We must remember how many animals we have exterminated and the consequences if nothing is done.

We could create cards showing endangered and extinct animals from different levels of concern to be sorted by an international organization. thereby, children could also use the cards for playing games, such as happy families. This would be a good seller, because everyone is concerned about the environment these days. Besides, we already have the copyright for many of the pictures because we already use them in other packs, so we can keep the costs low (probably similar or even less than our last product). However, we don't have a picture of a dodo but I am sure we will find such picture without a copyright restriction. I would really like to have a card showing a dodo because we could add the famous saying:head as a dodo.

EFCAMDAT,EF_54,Making an educational product for kids,"Mr. Smith, firstly, I'm writing to you so you can be aware of my new project, about new cards with endangered animal species. The players should be able to recognize specie's actual status, if the animal is threatened or not. The main reason for this project is the actual circumstance. People are getting more involved in green matters, being more responsible and caring for the nature. Moreover, it'd be a very cheap project, as we could use copyrights we already have. It's easy to imagine children playing card and, at the same time, learning about the threatened species. As you can see, not only the product will be well accepted, but also it will be a way for us to show our preoccupations on the matter. By doing this we will show everyone that we are concerned on educating the next generation. In the end, it is a noble cause that is really worth our time and effort, and my research indicates that this project will also boost our sales.

We are growing up, we are becoming adult and our values, I mean material and spiritual values, vary with us. As a result, our goals change. When we are children, becoming adult is our self-actualization. When we grow up to teenagers our self-actualization is to become popular at school and especially among teenagers of the opposite sex. In these age opinions of people around us are very important for us. And to be recognized is a necessary part of our self-actualization. Only many years later we usually realize that much more important for human is to remain by himself, than to please everybody. Im not exclusion. When I was a child the main goal was to be better than my sister. At that time I couldnt understand that my sister isnt a competitor and enemy. Only today I realize that sister is my nearest friend and soul. thereby today my self-realization is to be necessary, to be needed for people whom I love.

So the only beneficial renewable energy for our city is SOAR POWER. You may not see only the high costs of installing the solar panels, you have to see that we have a lot of sunlight every day, that will bring us money back. In our city we have a lot of large surfaces, where we can install solar panels. The energy from the sun gets converted into thermal or electrical energy, and we can produce our energy for so many things with the power of the sun. We could install solar canals on the roof tops of residental homes, companies and industrial buildings and every sunny day makes us happy twice :-)",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

All kinds of stuff it must preserve electricity. firstly: My favorite source is to invest and use solar panel. The sun gets converted into electrical energy. solar panels absorbed from the sun rays. The physiclic low: More sun more power, more panel more energy. By most of the houses in our town is installing possible. This is fact. What is the price? For instants, a single-family-house would cost between 20,000 to 40,000. But the sun shine is free. In estimate 10 years it will be a good investion and the profit came soon. secondly: Wind power is an old resource. The new modern high-tech is efficient, and use also a soft wind to turn the propeller from the turbines. The higher point in our region is 315 meters above sea-level. The cost to built a wind turbines would be 1,000,000. This investion is for a long term. What our decision will be.

We have more than 3,000 miles of ocean coasts most of them with strong tides whose energy could be transformed into electricity or other useful forms of energy. How? well, its an already well known technology based on the principle that tidal waves move water into power turbines, that kinetic energy gets converted into electric energy.

One may think that such a big company would bring development by creating many new jobs. In fact, these new work posts will be underpaid and the people who take them will wok under bad conditions - without social or health benefits, for example. furthermore, they won't have the opportunity of growing in their careers.

It was only after the Romans introduced this level of 'civilisation' that these countries truly developed. However, this is not true as any society will have structure and in this case, often well developed. Nevertheless, the imposition of the roman army on foreign ways of life would have had some influence in spheres such as urbanisation, the military, architecture and religion. By looking at some examples of towns and areas of Northern Europe I will analyse the contribution the army made. The strategy of the Roman Empire was generally to conquer by using minimum force. This usually meant that they would go in and take over existing structures, using the elite to control the people. In order to create a feeling of inclusion rather than oppression for the conquered people they would try to remove the army as soon as possible, leaving only what was necessary in the cases of frontier provinces, such as Britain and the Rhineland.

In the time when tortoise shells, bamboo slips, stone tablets, animal skins, and papyrus were used for writing materials to store information, being literate could mean being able to recognize the written form of language. It was also a time that literacy belonged to the minority, the privileged elite. With the rapid development of technology, more and more convenient mark making methods have been invented and become prevalent, which has inevitably brought about a myriad of new uses for writing languages. Consequently, what the students learn about literacy at school today may be obsolete when they leave school and enter the workforce or continue with higher education. Take myself for example, I learned to write with pencils and read with books when I was a primary school student. Now I write with computer far more than with paper and pencil and read a large amount of electronic materials that did not exist at all in my childhood.

Firms should not underestimate the high costs involved in staff turnover. A company looses £626 whenever a routine unskilled worker resigns and as much as £5.219 should a manager decide to quit his or her job (CIPD, 2001). Referring to relevant literature this essay will propose a framework of theoretical aspects which should be taken into account when dealing with the subject. At the same time it will present models of good practise for recruitment and selection. The essay will go on to evaluate if and to what extend these techniques are actually implemented in the industry and whether, by applying...","You are a university student.

Their work rages with controversy as with their theories that still spark incessant debates. Both are eminent psychologist that studied aspects of human behaviour concerned with obedience to an authoritative figure. Both psychologists studied this phenomenon differently using different methods. Zimbardo created a make-shift prison and Milgram created an electric shock experiment, to ultimately deduce the same conclusion. The conceptual reason behind Zimbardo's experiment was to test the power of social situations over individuals. The focus was on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity, and situational validation of ordinarily ego-alien behaviors and behavioral styles. Zimbardo explored the theory of deindividuation and its influence on obedience. The psychological state of deindividuation is aroused when individuals become part of a crowd or large group. This state is characterized by diminished self-awareness and individuality. There is a reduction in an individual's self-restraint and normative regulation of behavior which leads to a newfound obedience to any form of authority. Milgram on the other hand had a different hypothesis and focus. His study was inspired by the many atrocities that had been committed in the Second World War....","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_665,What is the Phillips Curve? Explain why critics believe the ratio no longer holds.,"In 1958, a study published by Alan W Phillips aimed to establish a negative relation between inflation and unemployment. His examination of the major economies of the world revealed a clear 'trade-off' between inflation and unemployment, his findings coming to be known as the 'Phillips Curve'. The establishment of such a relationship became a topic of significant interest to scholars and politicians alike; if such a relationship did exist, it carried with it a number of significant policy implications; the idea that Governments could maintain low levels of unemployment, by tolerating higher inflation rates. However, during the 1970's, the relationship appeared to break down, thus inciting scholars from all economic schools of thought, to attach their own theoretical explanations as to why the relationship no longer appeared to hold. Firstly this essay will investigate the derivation of Phillips curve in its original context, before exploring the developments provided by main scholars from the Keynesian, Monetarist and Neo-Classical schools of thought following the breakdown of the relationship. Through the use of real life examples to support the economic theories, this essay aims to establish why scholars believe the Phillips relation no longer exists, or if indeed, it ever did. * *...",You are a university student.

What may account for the nature of the change found?,"<heading>Introduction</heading>The French labour movement is typified as 'contestatory' and as embodying an ideologically and politically divided trade union movement (Valenzuela 1992:73). The argument that France's trade union movement is ideologically and politically divided is widely discussed and sustained and this indicates the significance of the issue (Bridgford 1991; Boltansk 1999; Daley 1999; Lange et al 1982; Moss 1987; Mouriaux 1983; Schain 1987; Verberckmoes 1996; Visser 2000). It is important, firstly, because 'the study of inter-confederal relations is central to any understanding of French industrial relations' (Bridgford 1991:82) and secondly, because divisions in the union movement can have a negative impact on trade union membership (Bean 1994:41; Rehfeldt 1999), collective bargaining (Schain 1987), neo-corporatist industrial relations (Valenzuela 1992:76) and hence, the entire industrial relations system. The main trade union confederations in France are the CGT, the CFDT, the FO, the CFTC, the CFE-CGC and UNSA, though it is acknowledged that the FEN and the US-GdD are influential trade unions, primarily in the public sector.

BAWE,BAWE_975,How did the Roman elites view foreign religions? Discuss.,"This essay will argue that the attitude of the Roman elites to foreign religions tended to range from disapproval to downright hostility, yet we cannot put this down to pure xenophobia. North has pointed out that ""the Romans were willing at almost all stages of their history to accept foreign cults and practices: evidently, something more is needed to provoke action"" (North 1975: 86). This acceptance of foreign practices can be seen in the importation of the cult of the Magna Mater, the welcoming of Mithraism, and the assimilation of some native religions into that of the Romans. Yet while some foreign religions were imported into Rome or assimilated into the Roman state religion, others were viewed with complete disdain and hostility. I believe that this was because these foreign religions were often seen as both a political threat, and as having practices that were anti-social and indecent. Together these factors caused many foreign religions to be viewed disapprovingly by the upper echelons of Roman society. To understand why Roman elites accepted some foreign religions, but were extremely hostile to others, it is important to give a brief summary of their religious background, and how they were attached to the...",You are a university student.

It is about 450 million people's second language, and there are around a billion people who understand it (The Sunday Times Word Power supplement 1993 part 3). However, all these people do not speak an invariant unchanging identical language. English has spread worldwide and with it, more and more variations have been derived. In this essay I will mainly focus on spatial variations of English. I will focus on English as it is used today, although it must be appreciated that the language is changing all the time. The three main areas in which there is variation are, as said by Paul Kerswill in his article ""Language Variation and its Social Function"" (updated January 2004), phonetic variation, grammatical variation and discourse strategies. These are what I will be concentrating on in this essay. Equality is the other main issue in this essay.

BAWE,BAWE_951,How was Augustus represented as 'between god and man'?,"<heading>Introduction</heading>Rome was a polytheistic society in which religion was a major part of life, thus in order to maintain power Augustus needed to place himself at the centre. He achieved this by creating an ambiguous image of himself which was somewhere between man and god. In order to do this he used a variety of public mediums such as statues, altars, coinage and literature. This can further be seen in his actions, for example the changing of his name from Octavian to Augustus following the victory at Actium, and the further renaming of the month of August. However, a society accustomed to being run by a group of senators would not have welcomed an autocratic leader imposing himself on them and calling himself a god. For this reason Augustus had to be very careful with the way in which he used these mediums, so as not to appear tyrannical and end up dead like his predecessor Caesar. <heading>Restoration </heading>When Augustus finally came to power after defeating Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Rome had been in political unrest for a long time.

In 2002 music sales fell by 7% worldwide, and these drops have persisted despite companies cutting CD prices by upto 31%. While many blame these plummeting sales on internet music downloads, others attribute them to changes in consumer tastes, to the development of alternative entertainment forms, or simply to a decline in the quality of the music produced. Whatever the cause, the music industry is clearly redefining itself. An analysis of the current situation divides its future along two possible extremes: on the one hand, if recording companies continue to resist the internet's technological advances through mergers and court cases, today's oligopolistic industry may tend towards a monopoly; alternatively, if the companies undergo the technological change exemplified by file-sharing agencies, costs throughout the music industry will fall and the market may become more competitive.

Analyse and explain the changes referred to here.","<heading>Introduction</heading>The reforms that have brought about the reconstitution of social housing necessitate a re-conceptualisation of the term itself. Up to the mid-1970s it was easy for academics to define the social rented sector. It had four distinguishing factors: its housing was built primarily with the help of state finance its housing was subsidised by the national government its main administrator was either the local council or non-profit organisations operating under the aegis of the government its rents were held below market levels. Since then, there has been a tendency for governments to facilitate the increasing role of private business in social housing and simultaneously increase their own role in expanding other tenures, blurring the once sharp division between the ""private"" and ""public"". In such a way, factor 1) is no longer applicable because spending on social housing is now overwhelmingly financed by borrowing from capital markets. Factor 2) can no longer be considered as a necessary condition because of the increasing complexity and proliferation in subsidies that benefit homeowners and tenants and landlords in the private-rented sector. However, factor 3) can still rightly be maintained as necessary conditions because private landlords rarely put the profits they accrue back into their...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_532,Set out and assess Berkeley's objections to Locke's appeal to the notion of resemblance in the account of our perception of mind-independent physical things.,"In this essay I will first outline Locke's model of perception as involving primary qualities that are related to actual physical objects, and then explain Berkeley's objection to this view. I will then introduce Locke's notion of resemblance as an attempt to justify our belief in these mind-independent physical objects, before assessing the success of Berkeley's arguments against the feasibility of such a resemblance. Finally I will briefly suggest that there are alternative models of resemblance that may survive Berkeley's arguments, but that these alternatives are not open to Locke within the confines of his system of perception. As a committed empiricist, Locke relies on perception to provide the basis for his entire conception of knowledge. Knowledge lies in our perception of the agreement between simple ideas which in turn arise from our perception of a mind-independent physical world. Simple ideas provide the basis around which Locke can construct a theory of knowledge and rational argument. This view is contrasted to the rationalism of Descartes, for whom indubitable, purely rational premises provide the building blocks of knowledge. Such a view leaves Descartes with absolute certainty about the rational or mental realm but doubtful of the reliability of our perception. Locke,...",You are a university student.

His interpretation of the tribute system has been no exception. However, in recent decades alternative explanations have emerged which challenge many of Fairbank's fundamental arguments. Even his model of the 'Chinese world order' itself has come under criticism. Scholars like James L.

BAWE,BAWE_733,Discuss E.M.Forster's preoccupation with connection and his search fulfilment.,"As a member of the infamous Bloomsbury group in the early twentieth century, E.M. Forster regarded the Victorian middle classes as leading an inauthentic life which prevented them from attaining social and personal fulfilment. He felt that they were denied any true pleasure due to their repression and the prison that their desire for respectability created. The epigraph to Howards End, 'Only connect', implies a need to unite and Forster explores this in his novels. Each story is based upon a number of binaries which he attempts to connect in order to create a socially and personally fulfilling existence. A search for truth, 'human wholeness' and 'cosmic unity' underlies the adventures of each of the main protagonists (p142, Rosecrance, 1982). Forster's ideas on the subject develop throughout his early career, yet his essential message is that individuals need to change something within themselves and their perceptions of the world in order to 'connect' to something greater than the Victorian ideals and therefore have a greater chance of fulfilment. This 'something' comes in a number of forms, such as a relationship, a truth or a spirituality.

BAWE,BAWE_1062,To what extent do readers rely upon information from decoding the written text and to what extent do they bring in information from external sources?,"<heading>Introduction:</heading>The teaching of reading involve two main routes, the lexical route and the sub-lexical route. The lexical route involves a teaching of words as a whole. Goodman (1996: 91) who supported the whole-word theory of reading suggested that 'an efficient reader uses only enough information from the published text to be effective'. This has been disputed by many who place more emphasis on the 'graphophonic system' (Gough and Wren, 1999:67) and the individual role of letters and words rather than whole texts. Adams (1990:105) suggests 'the single immutable fact about skilful reading is that it involves relatively complete processing of the individual letters in print'. This theory places more emphasis on the sub-lexical route whereby decoding via grapheme-phoneme correspondence is vital. Goodman's (1967) most significant claim was that reading was a 'guessing game'. His theory suggested that skilled readers use context to anticipate the words in a text therefore do not need to decode every word. Contrary to this theory is the more recent idea that a skilled reader is someone who can decode automatically without being conscious of it (Field: 2003). This theory also suggests that 'less skilled readers rely heavily on context' (Perfetti 1999:43) as a substitute for...",You are a university student.

In the aftermath of the incident, which would ultimately claim the lives of one hundred and ninety one Porteños, calls to make those responsible accountable for their actions heralded a prolonged period of protest, spearheaded by a series of organised marches through the city. Whilst the indictment and arrest of Omar Chabán, República Cromañón's eccentric owner, provided the immediate guilty party, the media's criticism of the local security authorities bolstered the public's calls for justice, with blame quickly attached to Buenos Aires's mayor Aníbal Ibarra for overseeing the negligence responsible.

BAWE,BAWE_314,Is there a role for induction in science?,"According to Miller (1994, p.1), 'The task of empirical science, like that of other investigative disciplines, is to separate as thoroughly and efficiently as it can the true statements about the world from those that are false, and to retain truths.' With this in mind, we must consider whether or not induction can play a part in this separation of true from false statements. By referring to an inference as 'inductive,' we are referring to the process of moving from singular statements - such as observations or results of experiments - to universal statements such as theories and hypotheses. While this may intuitively satisfy our idea of how science is practiced, there is no logical justification to suggest that we can infer universal statements from singular ones in such a manner. In the analysis of induction and its relevance to science, it is important to also recognise that inductive inference is more concerned with weighing evidence and judging likelihood than it is with the actual proof of a scientific theory. This raises the question as to how we can make such non-demonstrative judgements and believe that they are reliable.

Despite the consolidation of power during the reign of the Emperor Kangsi to Qianlong, there remained however, certain underlying grievances that were never fully eradicated, which led to the persistence of the themes such as 'Over-throw the Qing, Restore the Ming', ethnic and religious tensions. The end of the Qianlong era marked the conclusion of the golden age of Qing rule and saw the gradual decline of central power vis-à-vis the provincial power and the emerging western participation in Chinese politics. Though westerners have had a presence in China dating back to the Yuan dynasty, the Opium Wars and the corresponding treaty system marked a watershed for China-West relations, resulting in the change of status quo, of perceptions; and manifested itself in the increasingly intrusive presence of the West, which exposed the many weaknesses of the Qing state, making it more vulnerable to attacks from within.

Initial regulation was incidental, created through measures of approximisation for free-trade purposes. Later developments became more comprehensive. I will analyse the systems operation, extensiveness, effectiveness and accessibility. This narrative cannot be an abstract debate concerning the evolution of a legal competence; it must be placed in context. Can an economically-centred union really provide a balanced approach towards environmental sustainability; will it be typically anthropocentric, restricting regulation for financial gain, an economic quantification of the environment? Or will it create a comprehensive, accessible legal order with the essential supremacy and collective resources to fight this international issue effectively? Created from the ashes of war-torn Europe in the form of the ECSC, the EC was an economic union to create prosperity from a common-market, and prevent wars. The 1957 EC Treaty created a more recognisable inauguration, whilst the Merger Treaty formally established the EEC (1965). The UK joined following the Treaty of Accession.

The use of highly technical apparatus, for example MRI scanners and life support machines, are now in common use in the practice of western medicine, and the rapid pace of medical research has meant that medical technologies, together with the possibilities and promises they bring with them, are never long out of the media spotlight (Williams, 2003). From Dolly the Sheep, to the more recent engineering of tissue from patient's cells to reconstruct (and subsequently re-implant) damaged bladders (Chung, 2006), it seems that medical science is increasingly pushing back the boundaries of possibility, and reconfiguring our understandings of the human body, and its potential for manipulation .

BAWE,BAWE_288,Douglass North's Theory of Institutions: Key to Understanding Underdevelopment Today?,"Today's world is fraught with economic inequality: the breach between the incomes of 'Northern' countries and those of poorer 'Southern' countries is relentlessly widening. What explains such a trend? Why do some countries accumulate so much wealth while others become so radically poorer? Traditional economic theory has attributed underdevelopment to differences in resource endowments between rich and poor nations, or to Western exploitation of less developed states. Such theories, however, do not satisfactorily explain why underdevelopment persists in poor countries in spite of the guidance which more successful 'model' countries provide them with. Only recently has the persistence of underdevelopment been seriously considered; in particular, theorists such as Douglass North have looked to the role of institutions in shaping countries' economic performance. These scholars argue that institutions, when efficient, are vital to achieving modern economic growth; inefficient institutions based on incomplete information, however, irremediably harm economies' long-term development. Such claims can be investigated by looking into the role played by institutions in governmental structures, in long-distance trade, and in economic change throughout history.

We will then see how, despite some apparently obvious and significant differences, at their core the two accounts are relatively similar. Kant begins by explaining that we are grammatically incorrect to label an object or phenomenon as sublime. The sublime instead lies within the subject, as an experience which arises out of a particular state of the mind; what we call the sublime object is the cause of this mental process. Kant separates these sublime experiences into two categories: the dynamical and the mathematical, and we shall address both of these in turn. We call those objects or phenomena in nature which cause an experience of the mathematically sublime when they evoke an idea of infinity within us; whether spatial or temporal. Something is mathematically sublime if it is 'absolutely great', or, in other words, without comparison. Classic examples include a vast plain, the sky at night or the Grand Canyon. Usually to cognize the greatness of an object requires some other magnitude to compare it to, but this is exactly what is lacking in the absolutely great.

Assess this statement with reference to at least one play.","Classical Greek theatre played an essential role in the cultural life of democratic Athens. The drama at the annual festival of Dionysus was much more than just a piece of competitive performance theatre, it was one of the few institutions in a polis that intertwined religion, democracy and empire, creating a cultural spectacle that everyone was encouraged to attend. Amongst the sacrifices, parades, tributes and decrees, the plays of famous tragedians such as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were witnessed and admired by almost a whole community, becoming 'the great democratic art form'1. This made theatre an ideal platform to spread messages about Greek culture (defined by factors such as politics, society, war, role of women etc) through the citizens of the polis. Although conclusive evidence from the period is severely limited, it is clear from surviving scripts that the plays themselves were mostly based on Greek mythological stories.

It is determined by the supply side performance of the economy and reflects not only the overall productivity of the economy, but also the cost of production is each sector. Shapes of the AS curve are very different in Classical, Keynesian and New Keynesian models as a result of various assumptions and restrictions in each model. The Classical model assumes that the AS curve is strictly vertical. The level of output depends on factors of production, i.e. capital, machines and physical work supplied by labour during the production of output. The only way to increase output is to increase the levels of capital and labour. For instance, firms could employ more workers or increase their investment to raise the capital stock. Therefore, AS can only be affected by the levels of capital and labour and is perfectly inelastic to the price level. In the labour market workers face the choice between leisure and the real wage.

Wild animals have traditionally been hunted at a sustainable level, by indigenous forest foragers, for many years (Robinson and Bennett, 2000). Recently, however in response to an exponentially expanding human population and with the development of international trading the demand for bushmeat has grown (Bushmeat Crisis Task Force, BCTF, 2003). The introduction of modern hunting technologies has meant that enormous quantities of wildlife can now be extracted from forests annually allowing the sale of wild animal meat to evolve into a vast global trade. It has been estimated that sixty-three kilograms of wild meat per square Kilometre of forest, per year, is extracted for commercial sale in Bioko, Equatorial Guinea (Robinson and Bennett, 2000). It is thought that commercial hunting has become the most immediate threat to the future of wildlife in the Congo basin and has resulted in widespread local extinctions throughout West Africa (Warrick, 1998). Alarming findings have provoked concern from the western world and as a result a number of ""anti-bushmeat"" projects have been established, such as the Bushmeat Crisis Task...","You are a university student.

His knowledge of theology was based on the Roman Catholic interpretation of it. In 1917 he produced his 95 theses, yet 'opinions vary as to how well developed Luther's theology was' by this stage. What began as an attack 'against the abuses associated with Tetzel's indulgence peddling' became a condemnation of the papacy. In 1520-21 Luther produced three major treatises, and in them can be seen a real consolidation of his beliefs.

More significantly, during the 18 th century, William Stukeley created a record of the region including invaluable illustrations and descriptions of numerous monuments, many now partially destroyed, others completely lost. During the 20 th and 21 st centuries, the area has undergone sporadic excavation and non-invasive research by many including Harold St George Gray 1908-1922, followed by more intensive work by Alexander Keiller, 1925-1939. Following purchase of lands in and around Avebury, Keiller systematically excavated, recorded and in some instances, restored the monuments to such a high standard that following her own excavations, in 1965 Isobel Smith published Windmill Hill and Avebury: Excavations by Alexander Keiller 1925-1939.

BAWE,BAWE_939,The Structure of the Syllable and its Teaching Implications,"<heading>I) Introduction</heading>The syllable is the minimum possible unit of speech. As Katamba holds (1989:153) ""It is the unit in terms of which phonological systems are organised."" Consequently, the vowels and consonants that our speech is composed of can be regarded only as aspects of syllables. Speakers, based on their intuition, have no difficulty in deciding on the number of syllables a given word of their mother tongue contains. Phonologists, however, have faced great trouble in providing a single definition of what a syllable is that would stand for most of the languages of the world. Moreover, there is a great degree of disagreement upon how the internal structure of a syllable is perceived. The aim of this essay is to argue in favour of the onset-rhyme model of syllable structure given in Roach's book (2000) and to compare it with the flat structure model. Furthermore, suggestions will be given on two aspects that Roach could have included into his description of the onset-rhyme model. The second part of the essay will be focused on the teaching implications of the syllable in a second language learning situation, explaining why it is crucial for a teacher to bear a good understanding of...",You are a university student.

As Table 1 illustrates, taken from Myhill, A. and Allen, J. (2002) Home Office Research Study 237, although the number of recorded rapes has increased more than fourfold since 1985; the number of convictions has remained static. Added to this is the concern that many women do not even report the assault, so those who do are seen as the tip of the iceberg. As will shortly be illustrated, even this tip is decimated as the criminal justice system runs its course (Lees, 1997, p177). The criminal justice system at the present state gives a victim of sexual assault little hope of seeing the offender brought to justice. As Sampson illustrates, 'given the likelihood of any rape or sexual assault ever being reported to the police, given the reluctance of some police officers to believe the report and to record the crime, given the possibility of the identity not being discovered and given the reluctance of juries to...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_331,Which early infant abilities and preferences might facilitate later language development?,"Hundreds of years ago, Saint Augustine explained language acquisition by stating that babies learn by listening to the words parents use when pointing to objects around them (Gopnik et al, 2003). Whilst this account might seem intuitive, and does play some role in an infant's learning (Harris, 1983, in Butterworth & Harris, 2002), it is far from explaining the complicated language acquisition process in its entirety. Gopnik et al (2003) point out that children do not only learn names of objects, but verbs, adjectives and prepositions too. They have to distinguish human speech from other sounds in their environment, break down this continuous sound-stream into separate, meaningful words and understand different voices and pronunciations. Whilst these are hurdles which the most modern computers are nowhere near overcoming, normally developing children are able to conquer understanding and producing grammatical language to an almost adult-like standard by the time they are four years old (Gopnik et al, 2003).

The oldest records of whale hunts are rock carvings found in South Korea that date back to 6000 BC. Historical whaling can be divided into six main stages, some of them overlapping: The first being the Basque fishery (1400-1700): Hunting in the North Atlantic by Europeans; the Atlantic Northern Right Whale was a major target. Secondly the Atlantic Arctic fishery (1600-1900): Hunting moved north to around Spitzbergen, Greenland and in between. The Pacific fishery (1800-)is the third stage: American whalers moved into Pacific, targeting the Pacific Northern Right Whale. The fourth: The Sperm Whale fishery: As ""fast fishing"" techniques improved in the eighteenth century American whalers learned that the Sperm Whale contains valuable oil and exploited it around the world. The fifth: rorqual fishery (~1880-): the explosive harpoon was used for the first time and was devastingly effective in enabling the whaling of the very large rorquals in significant numbers.

Financially, therefore quality is very important. Should quality be up to sufficient standard, it could lead to increased margins, since costs can be visibly reduced.

It gives some background and history of third stage management and the use of oxytocics. It examines the research evidence comparing the two approaches, active and physiological, to determine which method is the safest. This essay also raises some questions regarding the third stage that are not satisfactorily studied and require further research. The third stage of labour is the period following the birth of the baby until the complete delivery of the placenta and membranes. It usually lasts between 5 and 15 minutes but can take up to an hour (Stables 1999). The third stage involves the separation, decent and expulsion of the placenta and membranes and the control of bleeding from the placental site (Johnson & Taylor 2000). After the birth of the baby the uterine muscle continues to contract and the placental site is reduced, oblique muscle fibres in the myometrium retract and constrict blood supply to the placenta (Stables 1999). A small amount of blood forms between the spongy layer of the decidua and the placental surface stripping it of its attachment (McDonald 1999). Once separated, the placenta and membranes...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_949,How far can archaeologists reconstruct past social relations using evidence for the disposal of the dead?,"Burial practises have been at the forefront of archaeological discussion for many years. The idea of using burial practices to examine the social relations of the past was long thought to be straight forward; a wealthy grave indicates a chiefdom or stratified society. However, due to the changing ideas presented by recent theories we have now come to look at the evidence in a more open minded way. I will look at how burial is examined; along with ideas about social complexity and to what extent grave goods affect our understanding of status. Historical sources and ethnography will also be used in examining the archaeology. Many early theories such as that of Spencer reduced societies to merely a few categories of complexity, such as band, tribe and state. This often meant huge generalisations were made and whole periods of time were put under one heading. This ignored the inevitable fluctuations and also meant complexity was being directly associated with inequality (Pearson, P 1999. p72). Binford argued that within a site each grave should be examined individually to determine its particular symbolism to prevent these sweeping generalisations (Pearson, P p73).

Alcohol is a combination of Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen (C2H5OH) and is produced by either fermentation or distillation. Because of its relatively simple formula, alcohol - unlike many other drugs - is quickly and readily absorbed by the body and its effects can be almost instantaneous (Royal College of Psychiatrists1979). A psychiatric nurse will regularly encounter alcohol abuse both on the ward and in the community. Statistics have shown the number of alcohol related admissions to psychiatric hospitals in England has risen sharply over the last few years, as has the incidence of alcohol related deaths (Cameron & Plant 2000). It therefore seems that the more informed the practitioner can be about the effects of this substance on the human body and the way it interacts with other drugs, the better professionally equipped they will be.

It is from this book that the concept of Taylorism evolved. Key to the question is that Taylorism was different to what had come before, and that it came about for specific economic reasons. This essay will try to explain what Taylorism is, where it came from, and why it came into any kind of existence at all. When Taylor published his book he believed that the working man had a natural tendency to 'soldiering' This meant that workers did less work than they were physically able to do (Taylor:1911:Chapter 1). Taylor noted two main reasons for this quasi industrial sabotage. Firstly it is that workers do not want to produce too much; as they risked of lowering the value of their, and their fellow worker's labour, in addition to decreasing the amount of labour needed for work.

It can be argued that stimulation of individuals within the organisation to high performance and contribution to their well-being is feasible for any organisation. Thus, finding a suitable organisational culture is important in human resources management (HRM) considerations.

With few formal and representative institutions during the early modern period, formal political participation of the people can be seen to have been minimal, seemingly reinforcing the assertion that they had no role to play in politics. Such an assertion however, can be seen to neglect recent scholarship, which suggests a less polar division between the people and politics, with a greater emphasis placed upon community involvement and the persist acts of resistance and rebellion. In order to then assess the role of the people in politics, we need to consider both the formal and informal ways in which the people participated. Most importantly we need to define the concept of 'politics', as our assessment ultimately rests upon its interpretation. Furthermore we need to consider the lack of homogeneity within the period. Divisions and differences can be found between as well as within composite states and kingdoms, making any over arching assessment problematic and difficult.

Below are four suggestions justifying what makes a professional engineer which I will discuss and conclude which I feel is most accurate. The first argument suggests that by having a BEng or MEng from an accredited university course, someone should be considered a professional engineer. I would say this is a very valid argument: it demonstrates that the engineer has spent a considerable amount of time studying the discipline and reached a level of competency recognised and approved by the governing bodies of engineering. Having an accredited degree in engineering should certainly ensure that high level engineering, such as large scale bridges or buildings or complicated (and consequently potentially dangerous) machinery, are built to a certain standard. With this level of study in engineering principals to the degree that they are accredited, we have confidence that they are constructed well by knowledgeable and experienced engineers - engineers whom we should consider to be professionals.

The greatest criticism of this thesis has been directed at MacPherson's definition of the term servant, which he argues encompassed all wage-earners.

Yet, there have not been any significant signs of recovery, even though it can be argued that there are prospects for a good economic year 2005 in the US. Nevertheless, oil price is a factor that can endanger the positive development in the economy and in can pose a problem in the trade deficit that the country struggles with. In addition, weak dollar might further deepen this difficulty. The uncertainty of the US economy is reflected on the other economies of the world, particularly on the Asian ones, but Euro Area has suffered from the fluctuations as well. Here, the main economic issues are dealt and the past, present and the future of the US economy is evaluated. <heading>2.

BAWE,BAWE_992,One of the most important observations in a corpus-based description of English is that patterns and meanings are connected,"A corpus-based description of English enables further insight into language beyond that which we gain from reference books and introspection of our own native language. The arrival and development of this approach in recent decades has led to much research into the behaviours of individual lexical items and phrases. Corpus analysis is concerned with patterns and frequencies and allows us to discover what is probable in language, by looking at statistical tendencies. Hunston and Francis have extended the application of the corpus based computer program to enable the studying of specific grammatical patterns. They played an important role in the creation of the Collins COBUILD Grammar Patterns Series (Francisal. 1996) which was the first time that the comprehensive range of verb patterns were methodically organised. They investigate the following hypothesis: ""that particular patterns will tend to be associated with lexical items that have particular meanings"" (2000:83). Halliday seems to follow this ideology, arguing that ""grammar and vocabulary are not two different things"" but instead refers to them as ""the same thing seen by different observers"" (1992b:63).

But what are not so obvious are the activities that were carried out there that define their functions. Problems arise in archaeology when we have only the foundational remains of a site with which to reconstruct a whole above ground structure and identify the function of a particular site. Here is where archaeologists employ the use of historical archaeology, whereby we may consult the historical evidence of a site rather than just its material remains. When identifying the functions of Roman town's archaeologists may look at the main features of roman urbanism, these include; a centre of administration (the forum), sites of public entertainment (theatres/amphitheatres), religious worship sites (temples), places of private occupation and sites of trade and commerce (markets). These particular functions can be identified through looking at the physical shape of buildings and creating a model which can then be applied to new and existing town plans to identify the functions just by looking at the physical appearance.

The first section will look at the proclamation of Vespasian as princeps in the east, citing reasons as to why Vespasian was put forward as emperor and how he gained the support of the eastern provinces and client kings. Secondly, I will look at how this core support, and the actions of individual commanders, enabled the Flavians to win key military victories against the Vitellians and thus remove Vitellius from power. Finally I will examine why Vespasian was able to hold onto power, unlike his three predecessors. During AD 69 Vespasian was stationed in Judea with the task of putting down the Jewish revolt, so his first step in becoming princeps was to gain the support of the eastern provinces, which would give him the necessary troops and resources needed to depose Vitellius. In the years after his succession it was traditionally claimed that Vespasian had been forced to fight for the Empire, due to the actions of Roman troops who were unhappy with...",You are a university student.

Discuss,"Essentially, there is a distinct difference between motifs of war being beautiful and inspiring as opposed to tragic and distressing. Principally, since the First World War, a handful of governments in Western Europe especially have attempted to find a balance between these seemingly incompatible effects. However, both commemorating soldiers- without making war appear heroic and desirable- and reminding society of the utter ugliness of conflict- without causing offence to the dead who sacrificed their lives so courageously- is extremely difficult to capture in one symbol. Arguably, time plays a crucial role in reducing the opportunity to find an equilibrium; to future generations that share no relationship with the lines of graves covering the Somme, memorials are rarely painful experiences, but instead quite the opposite. Visitors are normally attracted to the splendour and impressiveness of the architecture. Emotionally, the effect can be uplifting, arousing a sense of pride in the nation just by seeing the headstones of fallen brothers who fought and died side-by-side in one of mankind's prime historical events.

The Church used a variety of justifications for the crusades as people were questioning how war could be incorporated into the Biblical teachings of peace, love and forgiveness. The Ecclesiastical sources mention a number of times the awful treatment of the Church in Jerusalem as justification for the crusades, and the barbarism of the Saracens or Turks is constantly highlighted. Pope Urban II in his letter preceding the first crusade wrote that, 'barbarians in their frenzy have invaded and ravaged the churches of God.' This idea of barbarity is repeated many times. The atrocities against the Church and other Christians was also emphasised as justification - something needed to be done to put a stop to such treatment. Fulcher of Chartres described the 'warlike invasion' by the Turks, where they were, 'slaughtering and capturing many, destroying churches and laying waste the kingdom of God.'

BAWE,BAWE_182,The time consistency problem in Monetary Policy: How an independent Central Bank helps to reduce it,"<abstract></abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>A considerable effort has been made in economics in the last thirty years with the aim of answering important issues regarding monetary policy: why an economy ends up with positive inflation rates without any remarkable positive effect on output, and why it seems difficult to achieve a final outcome with zero inflation and, at least, the same output level. To answer these questions the seminal papers by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983a) (henceforth KP and BG, respectively) first developed an analytical framework based on the so-called time consistency problem (TCP). The policymaker faces a trade-off between unexpected inflation and output but, as the public incorporates that, the expected inflation is set at a sufficiently high level so that the government's best response is to validate this inflation and the output is not affected. Many suggestions have been assessed about how to improve this suboptimal equilibrium. For instance, KP and BG highlight that by imposing strict rules on the policymaker the TCP might be eliminated. Rogoff (1985), on the other hand, points out that by delegating monetary policy to a conservative central banker the TCP is reduced. Furthermore, this framework gives analytical support to the explanation about...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_130,How does neurobiological development constrain cognitive development?,"<heading>Introduction</heading>How does neurobiological development constrain cognitive development? The ambiguity in this question lies in the word 'constrain'. Cognitive development usually refers to the development of different cognitive skills (such as language) as one passes through childhood into adulthood. Alternatively, cognitive development may refer in a more general sense to the overall evolution of intellectual capacity during a person's life. Piaget's stage model exemplifies an attempt to describe cognitive development in this latter sense of the phrase, and aptitude tests such as WAIS are designed to describe it quantitatively. Neurobiological development on the other hand is the gradual unfolding and maturation of the brain as a result of hereditary and environmental influence. This biological development causes cognitive development, so in what sense can neural development constrain cognitive development? This question can perhaps be approached by looking at pathological as opposed to normal cognitive development. For instance, children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) develop small and malformed brains as a result of disproportionate amounts of alcohol in the womb. As a result they develop attentional and perceptual deficits, irritability and impulsivity, and general mental retardation (Passer & Smith, 2001).

Of course, I already knew that. Monopolists are rich and lazy; they have no competitors to put pressure on them, so they run their firms badly."" (Friedman, D. 1986) </quote>This quote, as cited by David Friedman, encapsulates a dominant, traditional view of monopolised markets and industries. This negative perception stems from the productive, allocative and welfare inefficiencies associated with the monopoly 'price making' structure, whereby the quantity and price are set equal to marginal cost, (P=MC) resulting in artificially high prices, under production and the extraction by the monopolist of supernormal profits; overall, leading to economic inefficiency. However, there are some economists and theorists of today who disagree with the traditional conception of monopoly economic inefficiency. Using ideas drawn from neo-classical theory and the work of economists such as Joseph A Schumpeter, this essay aims to address the extent to which monopolies can actually induce economic efficiency.

Almost half of today's two hundred and fifty primate species are thought to be of conservation concern in all of the ninety-two countries in which they occur (Rowe, 1996). Even more alarmingly, one in five primate species are classified as being endangered or critically endangered by the Primate Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN), suggesting their viable extinction within the next two hundred years (CITES, 2002). The threat facing primate populations is not evenly distributed. Results show a strong positive correlation across the continents, between extinction risk and human population growth (Wright and Jernvall, 1998), (see Appendix, figure 1). It has been found that those primates most at risk of extinction live in regions where human figures exceed 0.28 humans per hectare (Wright and Jernvall, 1998). While disease, predation and famine influence species densities the impact of human activities are so profound that they appear to over ride all other factors.

Different use of language for reasons of sex and gender are often placed into two categories, sex-exclusive differences and sex-preferential differences. Differences which are used exclusively by one sex or the other nearly all of the time are sex-exclusive differences whereas sex-preferential differences are those which are slightly less concrete in their usage and are more a question of frequency of usage.

As the population of the country as a whole doubled, the population of London quadrupled. In 1500 the population was just 50,000, but this had risen to 490,000 by 1700. There was a low fertility rate as only a small proportion of people were married and the poor living conditions in the capital resulted in a high mortality rate; yet the population continued to rise.

BAWE,BAWE_482,In what ways have feminists challenged conventional thinking about politics?,"Today the term feminism carries with it a great deal of stigma. To be a feminist implies an implicit hatred of men and all traditional institutions which have been formed by them. Increasingly western politics removes feminism from its agenda considering female emancipation has been adequately achieved with the right to vote, work and other civil liberties having been awarded to women. However despite this conception the fact remains that women in Britain earn seventy six pence for every pound earned by men and worldwide women earn just fifty per cent of what men earn thus illustrating, to some extent, the challenge posed by feminism for any democracy promoting equality, freedom from oppression and basic human rights for all women. Feminism is an evolving and expanding concept that continues to branch off into sub groups producing differing challenges for contemporary politics therefore to consign it to the historical dustbin with the suffragette movement underestimates it's relevance for today. The themes of feminism, adopted by several different sub movements within the ideology, permeate into everyday processes.

BAWE,BAWE_545,To what extent can a president's success be measured by his popularity?,"Popularity is often seen as the essence of a president's success; granted few tangible Constitutional powers and dependent upon media interest, he has little to rely on except dashing looks and a jolly smile. Popularity (defined as ""being liked or supported by many people"") is ultimately determined by a president's personality, and can go some way to ensuring elections are won, economic growth is encouraged, and misdemeanour is forgotten. Roosevelt, for example, is famed for his ""fireside chats"" during a period of economic turmoil and Clinton's presidency continues to be celebrated by many despite personal and political problems. In the short term, therefore, character determines popularity and hence how successful a president is perceived to be due to media influence and interaction with the public. Yet popularity alone does little to explain the prevalence of presidents such as Washington and Lincoln, whose personalities are long forgotten, in twenty-first century rankings of successful presidents. Nor does it explain why some presidents, whose popularity was high throughout their time in office such as Theodore Roosevelt, are little- known for being great today.

Discuss in relation to Middle Palaeolithic subsistence strategies.,"To must of us the word scavenging implies an unskilled act carried out by people or animals not clever or organised enough to hunt. However, is this really the case? Examination of the skills required to both hunt and scavenge seems to suggest that both entail similar activities, such as tool making and co-operation. From looking at an array of Middle Palaeolithic sites and their implied subsistence strategies I will assess the extent to which hunting is superior to scavenging, if at all. These sites will include open air sites such as Il'Skaja and Mauren, and rock shelter/cave sites like that at Combe Grenal and Guattari Cave. There are various problems which we will inevitably encounter when trying to evaluate the subsistence strategies of Middle Palaeolithic Neanderthals. For instance, the preservation prospects for plant material are very small so this element is largely missing in the evaluation. Although, bones analysed for isotopes showing the environments lived in show mainly open country animals so meat would have generally been the primary source of protein anyway. Animal bones from the sites may have disappeared post-excavation, and some are more susceptible to decay than others which may cause the data to be skewed....",You are a university student.

Consensus was neither reached in the time of Ranke nor is held at present, as notions of 'science' independently and together with 'history' have been in continuous development. E. H.

He acknowledges that the scientist and historian are similar at the foundational level to the extent that they both desire to explain, and are involved in a fundamental process of question and answer. 'Scientists, social scientists and historians are all engaged in different branches of the same study: the study of man and his environment, of the effects of man on his environment and of his environment on man.""

The first part of the paper examines this linkage in a two-step fashion. To begin with, each concept and issue that Realism emphasises most, is linked to the value, which has traditionally bee associated with masculinity, from which the concept or issue draws its legitimacy and importance. Having established the androcentric nature of Realism, which informs the theory's priorities, the section illustrates how these prioritised concepts and issues have proven detrimental to human rights. The second part of the paper briefly revisits Realism's priority- list, from the perspective of IR feminists. It also discusses how feminist redefinitions of the concepts and issues emphasised by Realism, could enable the creation of a system of international relations which is, at least relatively, more conducive to the realisation of human rights. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>Today, we are at a point in the history of the world where human rights have become highly imperilled, and the importance of human rights norms has escalated (Schmitz and Sikkink, 2001; p.2).

However, this period in European history has undoubtedly left a much more significant mark on its cultural development, than merely burned monasteries and plundered villages. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Europe faced an entirely different type of political, economic and social organization. While the south was dominated by the Gothic kingdoms, the north-west Europe was much less centralized and the system of chiefdoms was predominant in the early stage of post-Roman times. The growth of Frankish power and the spread of Christianity began the process of political and social changes, leading to early state formation. Changes in the character of production, the increasing social stratification, the intensification of trade, and the formation of urban-type centers and the early-feudal states were accompanied by the development of shipping of inland, coastal, and sea-going types, emphasizing the differentiation of tasks in the sphere of transport. Therefore, with the development of more advanced shipbuilding technology and the establishment of more centralized rules in Scandinavia, the so called Vikings initiated their sea voyages in search for new lands.

BAWE,BAWE_278,The Feminist Contribution to Political Thought: A Ground-Breaking Challenge,"The past centuries have witnessed an ""ongoing struggle between and amongst political ideologies"" as liberals, socialists, conservatives, nationalists and others have proposed rival interpretations of political reality. In spite of their many differences, however, the mainstream approaches have all ignored the political significance of sexual divisions. It is only with the nineteenth-century emergence of the women's movement, and more powerfully with the rise of 'second-wave' feminism the 1960's, that the issue of gender was ""raised . . . as a major challenge to the discipline [of political science]."" By forcing the customarily public scope of politics to embrace the private sphere, by exposing the patriarchal assumptions underlying conventional political theory, and by drawing attention to the fundamental role of gender in shaping all aspects of life, feminism puts the dominant institutions of political thought into serious question. The core feminist themes reveal that the traditional ideologies, and in particular liberalism, provide a highly biased and male-oriented interpretation of reality - they may consequently be ""inadequate vehicles for advancing the social role of women"".

The fundamentally different approaches taken by Descartes and Hume make the conclusions that each reach only applicable to the individual projects undertaken.

Hume's scepticism is also at fault at concerning the methods he uses to doubt such as his ideas of reducing probabilities and his subscribtion to the notion of sense datum. Descartes methods of casting doubt onto both the senses and reason are more plausible. Hume's scepticism is based on an idea that it is not possible to have certain knowledge and that as such, all our cases of knowledge are probabilities. I would deny that these probabilities always reduce to zero due to human fallibility and that this fault fundamentally undermines Hume's scepticism.

There are numerous theories which attempt to explain consistently low turnouts in both Presidential and local American elections.

The causes of apathy and deliberate abstention among the electorate, namely: a lack of representation (the inherent problems of a two-party democracy); exclusion from the political system and the reasons associated with the decreasing participation in community life and civic engagement in America and the lack of competition between the two parties, particularly in the 'safe states'.

In this essay, I aim to briefly consider the correct application for qualitative methods, and how objectivity can be maximised. Burt and Oaksford (1999) contrast the view of human nature and knowledge put forward by Morgan (1996, 1998, as cited by Burt & Oaksford, 1999) whereby science is seen as uncovering an objective, single truth about the world, and the postmodernist view of Stevenson and Cooper (1997, 1998, as cited by Burt & Oaksford, 1999), where knowledge is seen as constructivist in the face of no knowable objective truth. They conclude that the utility of a theory is not based on its objective truth, and also observe that psychology does not have the complexity of previous theoretical background that aids other sciences in their hypothesis formulation.

In this light, Athens, as a centre of 'Old Greece' famous for its classical legacy, poses a number of challenges to the archaeologists who wish to understand it as a Hellenistic city. The objective of this essay is to discuss the problems pertaining to archaeological investigations of Hellenistic Athens. Such problems include gaps in our factual knowledge due to the nature of evidence and the scholarly approaches underlying interpretations. An all-encompassing definition of the city includes an emphasis on its urban environment, institutions and civic traditions, resident elites and rulers, specific cultural features and networks of socio-economic relations. It will be assumed that all these aspects are relevant to an investigation of Hellenistic Athens but the primary focus of this essay...",You are a university student.

In fact, as a singular position put forth to capture various attitudes regarding knowledge and morality, perspectivism is thematized only once in his completed works, and twice in the posthumous notes published under the title The Will to Power. Despite the scant mention of the position itself, the idea of perspectivism is really a very central notion in Nietzsche's thought. Indeed, the fact that the position itself is so seldom the subject of discussion is, paradoxically, an expression of its importance. In what follows we will see how support of perspectivism necessarily complicates the mode in which it is presented. I will then argue that Nietzsche's method of inquiry, as well as the various styles he employs as an author, are in direct response to these complications. <fnote>See GS §354, WP §481 and WP §636. </fnote>Generally, perspectivism is the view that one's values, goals, bias, interpretations, or perspective are all necessary for, rather than impediments to, knowledge.

Grotowski's theatre career really began with his establishment of the Theatre of Thirteen rows with Ludwik Flazzen in Opole, a town sixty miles from Auschwitz in Poland. It was here that he lay down the foundations for 'poor theatre' but his greatest achievements as a practitioner would not take place until he relocated to Wroclaw on the first of January 1965.

This, however, has not always been the case and many hypotheses on the nature of its structure have been put forward throughout history. Nineteenth century science fictionalist, Jules Verne, proposed that, to account for the flawed calculation of the earths density, vast internal caves existed as hollows below the surface and in his popular children's story, 'Journey to the centre of the Earth' he exploited this fact by allowing the characters to descend through these air filled passages toward the centre of the Earth. Of course this sounds preposterous now but many of the arguments made by Verne hold true and at the time in which it was written, people believed that this was the knowledge of the scientific community.

At the foremost the ordering of society in the context of the Enlightenment led to a direct conflict between rationality and empiricism that resulted in a gender discourse within medicine. The growth of women's madness and the victimisation of women for the gains of the profession were exemplified in the changing conceptual understandings of gender. The medical profession provides a key illustration of an area where Victorian ideas on domesticity were reinforced, and had significant affects on the participation of class and genders in this field. The rise of the profession can been seen as reinforcing existing ideas, especially the prevalence of Enlightened ideas and Victorian domesticity, and additionally establishing new ideas that were consequential in the reinforcement of both class and gender divisions within society. The rise of professional medicine was arguably fuelled by ideas of the Enlightenment. This change resulted in significant affects on both the position of women in the community and had remifications for the class system. Prior to the formalisation of the medical profession, wise women provided for the medical needs of the community and this resulted in a sense...",You are a university student.

It has been transformed from Greek heritage with Homer, which then becomes Roman heritage with Virgil, Ovid and eventually Lucan. The changes in the nature of heroism and heroic figures have been substantial. Homeric epic is based around an idea of a 'shame culture', in which heroes were men who did great deeds of valour, by killing other great heroes, the greater the better, in battle and duel, as is shown in the 'Iliad'. This meant that, if a hero did a great deed, then, according to the 'heroic code', the hero would win 'timē' or respect from other heroes, and this was how heroes were judged; on results, rather than on lineage. By Roman times, however, heroic nature had changed with Virgil's 'Aeneid', and the figure of Aeneas as a more dutiful, or 'pius' figure, as he embodies all the values of a Roman, especially that of 'pietas', which is absent in many Homeric heroes.

Associations act to maintain democracy once it had emerged, especially resolving the initial problem of isolationism, which Tocqueville considers inherent in the transition to democracy. Moreover, associations play an essential role in encouraging and nurturing political participation in society through the collective activity, whilst maintaining the identity and importance of the individual.

Hybrid creatures were the predominant antagonist in many hero myths that date back to classical antiquity. It is interesting that 'in the neatly ordered Greek universe, which has reserved distinct compartments for the 'bestial', 'human' and 'divine'' there is no such compartment for those hybrid characters in myth. Even the word 'monster' is a vague description: The idea of 'the Monster is ubiquitous' and as such it remains unclassifiable, something which Lada-Richards argues is due to 'monsters' being 'culture-specific products.'

The 'national game' commands the devoted attention of an overwhelming proportion of the country's population, receiving substantial and wide coverage across a plethora of media outlets. At the forefront of this devotion within Buenos Aires and the country nationwide is the fierce rivalry between 'Boca Juniors' and 'River Plate', famous internationally both as the most successful club sides and for the intense competition between them. Owing to the two clubs traditional association with opposite ends of the country's social and economic hierarchy, an Argentinian's choice of team, particularly that of 'Porteños' within Buenos Aires, entails an affiliation with a specific societal segment. Accordingly, Boca Juniors fans are fundamentally regarded as supporting a team of the people, with those of their River Plate counterparts theoretically tied to the country's upper echelons. As an internal societal phenomenon, the rivalry functioned throughout the twentieth century to reinforce people's notions of class and discrepancies in wealth.

The advantages of a hoplite phalanx over other contemporary fighting styles were that it ensured soldiers would fight with order, discipline and follow strict fighting tactics - due to this making survival much more likely. Tracing the development, nature and consequences of hoplites is made difficult by there being a limited amount of conclusive evidence, therefore interpretations must rely on what is available. When studying the development of the hoplite style, the major question is how the transition was brought about - whether heavy armour made possible the phalanx, or the introduction of the phalanx pressed the need for armour. A key factor in deciding this argument is to assess why the hoplite phalanx was able to develop in the seventh century and not before. This seems to be due to the state of the Greek economy, which allowed the armour for the hoplites to be built on a mass scale. Oswyn Murray states ""By...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_40,Critically evaluate psychological theory and research on the process of deliberation in juries,"There have been relatively consistent findings regarding the effects of group decision making compared with individual decision making. Groups tend to polarize towards the given majority and individuals often become more extreme in their preferences after the group discussion compared to before (Myers and Kaplan, 1976). The mediating mechanism operating between the pre and the post decision is the deliberation process. Deliberation has a large impact on jury decision making, which is reliant upon individual jurors discussing the evidence as a group, and returning with an often unanimous verdict. The majority of research on the jury has focused upon how individual jurors reach a verdict before the discussion, such as studies supporting the Story Board Model of juror decision making (Pennington and Hastie, 1992). Although this is a theory investigating how the individual decides upon a verdict, it does have implications for the deliberation process. There have also been attempts to produce Social Decision Schemes to assess the probability of deliberation resulting in a guilty, not guilty or hung verdict, depending upon pre deliberation verdicts (Davis, Kerr, Stasser, Meek and Holt, 1977).

Two classic models of corporate governance are the shareholder model and the stakeholder one.

Due to historical reasons, there are large differences between international corporate governance systems (Witt, 2004). However, much attention has surrounded the issues on whether national corporate governance systems will converge and if occurs, which direction it is towards to. Without neglecting those matters, the essay emphasises on the factors which might be considered to undermine the national distinctive system of corporate governance, with a fairly deep reference to Germany.

BAWE,BAWE_426,"Discuss and evaluate, with the use of examples, the extent to which social control has become a prime function of modern medicine.","Modern medicine is the product of ongoing change and progression. Where once medicine held a relatively narrowly delineated position, today it is a complex and highly organised socio-political institution (Lupton, 1995, p.2). Its role within our society has altered significantly, becoming increasingly encompassing in its scope. Many contemporary writers indicate the way in which medicine as an institution has taken over various functions previously overseen by religion or the law (Illich, 1995, p.1652) and it is here that its potential to exert social control must be placed. When one uses such terminology in relation to modern medicine, it is important not to consider only the direct, often violent, coercion of peoples that the term can imply. Social control is defined as the encouraging, or enforcing, of particular types of behaviour through the establishment of social norms, where that which does not meet the norms is deemed deviant. In this wider perspective, it is far easier to conceptualise the ways in which medicine might become coercive and controlling. A good place to begin when examining the social control element of modern medicine is the idea of surveillance.

BAWE,BAWE_5,Consider how Victorian notions of women's madness affected the lives of women in class specific ways,"Victorian notions of women's madness were largely influenced by the Victorian Domestic Ideology; paramount during the nineteenth century in defining gender roles, responsibilities and acceptable behaviour. This primarily concerned the middle classes, establishing ideals of womanhood and femininity that were arguably damaging both to those directly targeted as well as other groups within Victorian society striving to emulate the middle class depiction of morality, sobriety and modesty. At the same time, the notion of madness as a disease was becoming increasingly apparent within Victorian society, further highlighting gender and class divisions through varying perceptions of madness and its origins. Whilst there were significant implications in terms of gender, this essay will mainly deal with the effects of social class on women's experience of madness in Victorian England. Firstly, it is important to understand that madness, in all its various forms, was seen as a female illness. Femininity became inextricably linked with hysteria, along with neurasthenia and anorexia nervosa. The main reasoning for this is to be found in the prevailing misogynistic understanding of female sexuality in nineteenth century England.

In the 1960s and 1970s many course-books, such as Streamline, followed an audio-lingual method, with grammatical structures presented through dialogues and then drilled. Repetition was assumed to 'fix' utterances in the minds of the learners. Reacting against this approach, some writers even dismissed the teaching of pronunciation as unnecessary, concluding that 'little relationship exists between teaching of pronunciation in the classroom and attaining proficiency in pronunciation' (Suter, 1976) cited in Otlowski, 1998).The widely adopted 'communicative approach' with its emphasis on spoken English, again led pronunciation to be given greater prominence. The aim was now not to achieve what is commonly known as 'linguistic competence' or correct manipulation of form, but rather what Hymes (1972) refers to as 'communicative competence', linking grammar with socio-linguistic features such as intonation.

This was the first piece of vernacular history in French, predating the earliest Anglo-Norman texts by two decades, and continental French texts by a century.

One is the need to be flexible in order to tackle emergent changes in the micro and macro environment, whilst the other is the necessity to implement long-term strategic direction. This essay will discuss whether increasing short-term flexibility or pursuing a long-term strategic plan is more fundamental. Most businesses operate alongside a constantly changing internal and external environment.

The external (or macro) environment, on the other hand, refers to the market in which the business is operating in. Although the unpredictable environment directs businesses to numerous opportunities, it also generates a high level of ambiguity and insecurity in the firm. In order to cope with these changes and to sustain competitiveness in the market, businesses are required to develop swift responses to internal and external changes.

BAWE,BAWE_38,Why are some children more popular than others and what consequences does this have for psychological development?,"Popularity is an extremely difficult concept to measure as popularity is variable across cultures and ages. Characteristics defining a child as popular at the age of 8 may not be the same characteristics which define a child as popular at 14. Another problem arises distinguishing friendship from popularity. A child may be perceived as unpopular but still have a few close friends, and it is important to consider this when looking at psychological development because popularity is multi-faceted as opposed to one dimensional. It has been shown that unpopular children are more likely to have psychological difficulties such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, mood disorders and criminal behaviour (Kupersmidt, Coie and Dodge, 1990). Because of this, an important issue when looking at the effect of popularity on psychological development is cause and effect. This issue is covered extensively in the essay as it is valuable, yet difficult, to try and determine whether being unpopular causes problems with psychological development, or whether underlying psychological difficulties cause the child to behave inappropriately and become unpopular.

BAWE,BAWE_283,Escaping from Cynicism in Interstate Relations: A Review of World Views on International Politics,"Of all the areas of social science studied today, world politics may be one of the oldest and most persistently controversial. Over the years, changes in political interactions have sparked the emergence of numerous different approaches to the field. Today, the 'world views' that remain dominant are Realism, Liberalism, and Marxism. Each of these theories rests on distinct assumptions which shape both their interpretations of world events, and, more importantly, how international politicians consider the world when taking decisions. An understanding of these world views is therefore essential to students of world politics, as they not only help us to interpret the past, but to understand the likely future development of international relations. As we enter the 21 st Century, Marxism seems to be regaining the momentum that it lost with the end of the Cold War, while Realism arguably triumphs in the academic domain, and liberalism is most often used to support political moves. To comprehensively study world politics it is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of these approaches in explaining today's world; one may do so by comparing Realism, liberalism and Marxism based on their main assumptions and on their degree of empirical backing throughout history.

BAWE,BAWE_123,It follows from the first theorem of welfare economics that the educational system would work more efficiently if schools were profit-motivated firms instead of state sector agents. Discuss.,"The First Theorem of Welfare Economics guarantees that a competitive market will exhaust all the gains from trade: an equilibrium allocation achieved by a set of competitive markets will necessarily be Pareto efficient. Under these conditions, competitive markets also lead to efficiency involving the allocation of resources over time and under uncertainty. As education is not a homogenous product, this essay first argues that in the market for tertiary and higher education, it would be more efficient for educational institutions to operate as profit-motivated firms instead of state sector agents. Nevertheless, market failure exists and equity issues are omitted in the First Theorem of Welfare Economics. Therefore, the second part of this essay examines the situations in which state intervention in the education system, especially that for basic education, is warranted.

BAWE,BAWE_980,To what extent were people responsible for extinction during glaciation and post glacial?,"The late Pleistocene was witness to the mass extinction of mega fauna. The climatic changes at the end of the Pleistocene cause the steppe tundra receded and replaced by boreal woodland and boggy tundra. The melting of the glaciers was so rapid, according to ice cores from Greenland, that it may have only taken 50 years for the temperature to rise 7 degrees causing the climate change from an artic to a temperate climate at the beginning of the Holocene. The extinctions were disproportionate between continents. Between 16-11,500 BP 33 genera of Mega Fauna in North America became extinct, whereas in Africa only 7 Mega fauna became extinct (Roberts 1998). The scale of the extinction and of the varying effects it had upon the Mega fauna population is suggestive of an additional factor other than just climate change. This essay will explore to what extent people were responsible for the extinction of these animals and what other factors may have contributed.

Almost every publication features its own classification of what a determiner is, what subcategories there are, and on what grounds to distinguish them. To answer the questions at the heart of this essay in detail, a systematic overview of the most prominent approaches to premodifier categorisation would be helpful. Unfortunately, this would exceed the time and space constraints evident in this assignment; therefore the different classifications of various scholars will only be referred to when they are of immediate relevance to the essay questions.

Despite suggestions in the media to the contrary, terrorists and suicide bombers actually do not show any signs of psychopathology (Silke 2001; Crewshaw 2000). Therefore, it is the job of social psychology to explain the processes that lead an otherwise normal person to join a terrorist group and commit an act of terrorism. Also, the impact of terrorism is greater than the sum of the lives it takes and the people it maims - it has a huge effect on the people in the wider community that perceive they have been attacked. The processes that influence the impact of the terrorism also need to be explained. If we have sufficient understanding we can use it to inform policies that will bring a reduction in incidences of terrorism and the negative effects it has on people in the attacked community. However psychologists such as Silke (2001) have criticised psychology's response to the challenge of studying terrorism, describing it as limited, patchy and of dubious quality.

BAWE,BAWE_533,Should morality be private?,"In this essay I will briefly outline the distinction between a belief in objective moral truths and a belief in moral relativity. I will then suggest that even if we accept one or other of these views we are not consequently tied to a certain answer to the question of whether morality should be private. If we reject objective moral truths we may still be reluctant to adopt a relativist viewpoint due to other, mainly political, considerations. Similarly, if we accept that morality is objective we may nevertheless believe, perhaps because of certain religious views, that morality should be a matter for the individual. Finally, I will argue that the introduction of categorical and hypothetical moral imperatives allows for the conception of an argument based on hypothetical imperatives that perhaps both the moral objectivist and the moral relativist will be willing to accept. A distinction is traditionally drawn between moral relativists and moral objectivists. Objectivists believe that there are moral facts, and that the question of whether an act or a person is good or bad has a specific answer that is the same for every person.

BAWE,BAWE_1096,"Is knowledge Justified True Belief? If not, why not?","It seems odd to analyse a concept which is so thoroughly engrained in common language such as that of knowledge. However, since the early writings of Plato philosophers have questioned what it is to know something. Distinctions have been made between capacity knowledge, knowledge by acquaintance and propositional knowledge, each with various difficulties associated with them. The most fundamental debate surrounds the concept of propositional knowledge; what it means to say we know a particular proposition. One such response has been to claim that knowledge is justified true belief. This is known either as the tripartite definition or more generally, the standard analysis. In attempting to define a concept like knowledge, theorists are looking for a set of conditions which cover all aspects of how we use that concept. These conditions must be necessary and sufficient; each condition is essential to the concept and the combination of these conditions is enough to satisfy the demands of the concept. In the case of knowledge as justified true belief, theorists have identified 3 conditions that are said to successfully fill the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge. Predictably, these conditions are truth, belief and justification. The truth condition is pretty much universally...","You are a university student.

A Critique,"<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>The multi-level governance approach provides the conceptual framework for a new agenda in European studies which is concerned with comprehending the paradoxical nature of the policy system. Multi-level governance may be regarded as an advance in the comprehension of the EU polity because it provides the possibility to break free from the traditional preoccupation with the contradiction between national and supranational authority and prescribes for an explanation of how the system works. Multi-level governance is analysed here in order to show how the shortcomings of traditional explanations of the EU can be overcome. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates how the multi-level governance approach advances our understanding of the EU's complex polity. The multi-level governance framework conceptualises a system of governance open to a variety of theoretical perspectives in order to explain an abundance of constitutive issue areas. The assumption is not that the multi-level governance approach constitutes a theory in its own right. However, this essay attempts to demonstrate that theory can be developed within the multi-level governance framework with an assessment of three areas of scholarship: Europeanisation, New Institutionalism and Policy Network Analysis.

Far from a traditional, realistic, militarised and state-centred concept, the debate now includes a comprehensive approach to security problems. This evolution can be seen as a real opportunity to minimize the importance of the sovereign state in the concern problematic of human security. But it also contains several pitfalls. If everything that causes a decline in human well-being is labelled a 'security' threat, the term loses any analytical usefulness and becomes vaguely synonymous with 'bad'. In this essay I will try to question the polemical nature of global security through the securitization of the environment. The notion of environmental security is considered today as an issue of global security. The problem is that both concepts of environmental security and global security are used as if they were self-evident.

His view is about the status of moral values and the nature of moral valuing, rather than one that bluntly condemns all moral judgements (first order view).

Their repudiation of the high levels of state regulation and interference that characterised the governments before them was borne out of the conviction that social democracy had taken Britain into economic decline and that only constricted public expenditure and the further integration of markets into public life could remedy the malaise. The main principles that informed the Conservative approach to social policy were the supposed need to: control inflation, end the dependency culture, expand property ownership, tackle bureaucratic monopolies and increase competition within the public services and lastly reassert government authority. Whilst these principles are intermeshed, and it is rather artificial to present them as discrete from one another, in the interests of clarity the essay will do so nonetheless.

Perception is the recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli based mostly on memory. A sensation does not occur without a perception following. Humans utilize their senses to perceive their surrounding environment. To make sense of their connection, one has to delve into the biological beginnings. The science of sensation is called psychophysics. Psychophysics is concerned with physical stimuli of the senses and the occurring psychological reactions. Perception is an individual incidence and to be able to study them, psychologists have reduced these perceptions to numbers. Simply put, sensation is a physical response to a stimulus that is converted to a perception in the brain. On a very different note, an exception to the sensation/perception link is perceptual illusions. The occurrences of perceptual illusions imply that what we sense from our sense organs is not necessarily what we perceive it to be.

BAWE,BAWE_1083,What can we infer from burial rites of the 5th to 8th centuries AD in Europe?,"Our information about the 5 th to 8 th centuries AD is sparse. Objects from this time are rarely preserved, due to the decomposition of artefacts. One way of gathering information is through the understanding of Burial rites. These burials are open to much interpretation and are not able to give information on all aspects of life at this time. Burials can show how the people of the time wished to express their society in the areas of hierarchy, ethnicity and gender distinctions. We also get information about immigration and trade. Burial rites are mostly shaped by the religious views of the society so the burials could give a representation of the theology. Changes in burial rites at the end of this time could show the rise of Christianity. Within Britain in both early and late cemeteries, cremation and inhumation were practiced simultaneously.

BAWE,BAWE_251,Examine the Indian position and response to Creole republicanism in nineteenth century postcolonial Peru.,"Breaking formally with Spain in 1821, postcolonial Peru would witness significant changes in the state's approach to its indigenous majority and the ""Indian problem"". Peru emerged after independence as thoroughly divided, comprising an ethnically heterogeneous peasant mass scattered throughout a diverse landscape, and a small pool of largely city-residing elites determined to secure national progress. Influenced by the core ideals of La Ilustración and a Bolivarian desire to extirpate colonialism's despotic legacy, the limeño ruling class pursued a republican project of integration to secure its position at the apex of national authority. In line with this enterprising trajectory, the tribute and provincial cacique systems were abolished in the immediate post-independence years, furthering the colonial assault on the indigenous nobility begun in the wake of the Túpac Amaru rebellion of 1780. In irrigating the coastal economy, a thirty-year guano export boom would however effectively undermine state-sierra relations and Creole attention to the hinterlands, facilitating the rise of a regional caudillismo. Despite the liberal republican discourse fuelling a modernising drive, Indians were routinely contained along established lines of ""paternalistic exploitation"", the contradictions of which would come to enhance their political consciousness and inspire salient instances of revolt.

Whilst there have been famous cases of chimps being taught to produce signs I don't believe it can be said that Chimpanzees 'have language.' Whereas human children go on to be able to produce language spontaneously, as well as developing grammatical and syntactic systems, chimpanzees simply do not. Chimps have undoubtedly been taught to use signs. In the 1930's for instance Winthrop and Kellogg raised an infant chimpanzee alongside their infant son.

A psychological disorder can be defined as a dysfunction within an individual that is associated with distress or impairment in functioning and a response that is not typical. The behaviourist approach in psychology understands human behaviour as a consequence of conditioning. This approach claims that all human behaviour is shaped by reinforcement from the environment and the consequences of actions. Humans become conditioned to respond to our environment as a result of leaning by association or operant. Learning by association or classical conditioning is attributed to Ivan Pavlov and his theory of classical conditioning, while operant conditioning, or learning by way of reward and unpleasant consequence, is credited to BF Skinner. Operant conditioning states that all behaviour is a result of learning, of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement and punishment. (Skinner, B. F., 1974) Perhaps a person has been rewarded for doing exhibiting certain behaviour in the past and these acts as positive reinforcement and helps sustain the behaviour. Similarly, a person may have been told off for exhibiting a certain type of bad behaviour and these acts as punishment and a deterrent of such future behaviour.

Nonetheless, all these diverse poetic devices culminate to assist in the understanding of the poem as a whole. The poem's rhyme scheme follows an almost constant regular pattern, comprising aaab, cccb, dddb, eeeb, fffg, (though some of these are pararhyme). In effect, this imitates the form of a song, which is further reiterated by the repetition of the line 'Forget not yet,' mimicking what would be the refrain; however a certain irony lies in this predominant line of the poem. The regularity achieved through the repetition of 'Forget not yet' builds up an anticipation of continuance, yet the line itself perhaps implies departure; hence, a fitting sense of closure is achieved through the break in the regularity of this repetition in the final line of the poem, where 'yet' becomes 'this. ' In addition, it could be suggested that the internal rhyme used in the line 'Forget not yet' seeks to emphasise the word 'forget' and thus bring about a further sensation of closure.

Trade with the East flourished and as did that within Europe. This was brought about with such developments as the establishment of a banking system with a fundamentally different and adequate system of book keeping and re-development of the infrastructure necessary for vast amounts of goods to travel through Europe. There is much evidence, although not quantitive, such as the increased social status of the merchant and banker and the rapidly expanding nature of commercial ports and towns such as Venice. However, the extent to which this all occurred in the thirteenth century alone is questionable. Many of the roots for such an explosion of trade lay in earlier centuries, for example by 1200 many Italian bankers had extended their role from money changers, entering the field of banking proper.

Furthermore, the majority of the people suffering obesity within that increased rate are children, and the food industry should take most of the responsibilities, especially the 'Junk food'.

To differentiate between pre-industrial growth and modern economic growth, we use Kuznet's definition of modern economic growth, which is summarized by the following 6 characteristics. The first criterion is to show high rates of growth per capita as well as growth in population. In other words, growth must not be associated with extensive growth, where GDP levels only rise because of a rise in population while standards of living remain the same. The second criterion is to show a high rate of growth per output per unit of all inputs. This means that there must be total factor productivity growth, where productivity of all inputs rises (e.g. not just a rise in output per labour). Thirdly, there must be a high rate of structural change in the economy. For example, a shift from an agriculturally based economy into an industrially and service based economy.

Economic growth can be defined as an increase in the productive capacity of a country to produce more output over a period of time. This period is undoubtedly the ""golden age of growth"" because from 1950 to 1973 real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita growth was the highest at 3.7%.

Strong foreign accent may result in the difficulty in listeners' comprehension and sometimes it is considered as weakness of pronunciation as the same as speech defect, hyper-nasal and dialect (Rodman, 2000). Therefore, while speakers are trying to reduce their foreign accent in various ways, linguists have researched into the factors affecting degree of L2 foreign accent attempting to find the deep reasons of this phenomenon. This essay is going to review two articles, namely, Factors Affecting Strength of Perceived Foreign Accent in A Second Language (Flege, J, Munro, M., & Mackay, I. 1995) and Factors Affecting Degree of Foreign Accent in An L2: A Review (Piske, T.

BAWE,BAWE_64,Should we be worried about the effects on children of aggressive images on film and television?,"Watching television has become an increasingly popular leisure activity in recent times. It has become especially popular among children with more children's programmes available, and the introduction of entire channels dedicated to them. As well as violent and aggressive images that some children's programmes contain, children are also exposed to adult programmes that are violent and aggressive in nature. As a result of this viewing, there are increasing concerns about how these aggressive images affect children's development and whether they encourage children to be more aggressive. Psychological research provides an attempt to address these concerns. One area of relevant research is the proposition of theories to explain ways that children may learn to be more aggressive through watching aggression in films and on television. One theory about the learning of aggression was proposed by Huesmann (as cited in Josephson, 1987) and was concerned with the formation of social scripts. Social scripts are ways of solving problems and are learnt by observing the behaviour of others. The following of a script is almost automatic and tends to be spontaneous. In the case of watching aggressive television, children who watch it frequently will acquire social scripts about aggressive behaviour, and with the...",You are a university student.

How Stalin, the least obvious of Lenin's potential successors, came to be in this position is a much contested issue. With his death Lenin left a vacuum within the party leadership creating economic, social and political uncertainty. This in turn led to a left / right divide within the Politburo over the next steps the Bolsheviks should take, with Trotsky on the left arguing for rapid industrialisation. Stalin maintained a generally moderate position before siding with Kamenev and Zinoviev forming a powerful triumvate against the man they saw as their biggest rival.

Being tow different things the mind has different attributes to those of the body. Like the body, the mind is an existing thing rather than just a concept or linguistic place holder.

Instead of viewing society as Durkheim did, that is, as a generic force working externally of the individual and reifying itself through organisational structures and artefacts, Simmel was rather concerned with giving a 'serious [...]analysis of the social bond' (Nisbit 1959: 479), which can be described as the reciprocally working relation between two or more social actors. He denounced the view that a society ""as such"" could exist outside individuals (Simmel 1971a: 27), preferring to build a sociological system from the individual's standpoint. In the first place, Simmel represented social interaction as the dynamic attempt to reconcile the opposite drives within each human being - 'for example, the individual and the group, the need for conformity and for individuation, the need for stability and for flexibility' (Abel 1959: 478). Despite the theoretical character of these opposites, Simmel believed all ""forms-of-sociation"" are to some extent conditioned by the tension between them.

If a private language is not possible then it destroys the concept of the soul in the Cartesian sense and as a result it undermines the whole of Cartesian philosophy; if there can be no private language there can be no Cartesian Subject.

The main reason for this turn of events can be attributed to Britain's growing attempt to stifle America's growth through a series of trade acts and economic regulations which highly favoured Britain. This type of control, without any consultation with the American officials, ended up creating an anti-British sentiment which was added to by a variety of factors which appeared during that century. Even as early as the 1730's Britain had passed a series of laws which put American traders at a disadvantage, ranging from prohibiting the exportation of colonial made felt or hats to a law decreeing in 1736 that all sails made in the colonies had to be made of British cloth.

Religion proved to be a key aspect for the Inca elite in motivating such expansion, and equally in its role as a tool of subjugation and conformity to a highly centralized and stratified state apparatus. Religious beliefs popularized by the state would facilitate a long-term design for cohesion within the empire, simultaneously legitimating the imperial ambitions of Cuzco. The state cult that evolved sought to appeal to and manipulate existing provincial spiritual beliefs to herald the Inca dynasty as divine descendants of a supreme sun-god deity. This attempted superimposing formed the principal part of the state's scheme of promoting a ""dominant culture"" aimed at universal conformity to a divinely appointed administration. In striving to obtain increased resources and subjugate non-Inca peoples, the Incas pursued a relatively patient approach to modifying local traditions and spiritual beliefs, tolerating customs and permitting them to continue to exist alongside those new beliefs they professed, with a view...","You are a university student.

One reason for this is the emergence of collaborative software like weblogs and, in particular, the ""wiki"". Wiki comes from the Hawaiian word for ""quick"" and is a relatively unstructured medium for distributing information. A wiki is made up of various hyperlinked documents that can be collectively edited using a browser. In the words of Bill Walsh, ""In the old days people had only (professionally edited) newspapers, magazines and books from which to take their usage cues. In the Internet world everyone's a publisher [...] But if everyone's a publisher, can everyone afford an editor?"" (""Lapsing into a Comma"", Contemporary Books, 2000). This essay examines the arguments for and against the use of the wiki as a disseminator of knowledge. Questions will be asked about the accuracy of that knowledge and the societal impact of collaborative software.

BAWE,BAWE_901,The role of time in drama and the novel,"In this essay I will be discussing the way in which time is used in the genres of Drama and the Novel. In particular I will be focussing on The Winter's Tale (Shakespeare, 1610) and Emma (Austen, 1816), and will look at ways in which time is used in these texts. Novels have been described as 'long narratives in prose dealing chiefly with contemporary life'. These long narratives generally consist of a detailed plot and storyline, this detail creates a fictional world in which the reader can enter and explore into. Novels are designed for private reading, during this time the reader interacts with the characters and internalises the scene and setting. This fictional world becomes more realistic for the reader when a sense of time is added. When the reader is put into a time-specific moment in a novel, the moment reads with a more realistic feeling. The moment becomes more intimate with the reader, and, by sounding more realistic, the time-specific moment draws the reader into the text more than if time had not been added. This enables the reader to internalise the story more. An example of a time-specific moment in a novel is: <fnote>Rob Pope, The...",You are a university student.

Cultural upheaval and political instability inevitably changed the climate and definition of tragedy. Theological speculation and the revival of epicureanism led to people being suspended between faith and reason. Such issues permeate Othello.

Furthermore it is more practical to study a time period of three or four decades. Therefore to demonstrate that sugar brought about a social revolution in addition to an agricultural revolution, this essay will focus on the islands of Jamaica and Barbados from around the years 1630 to 1690. This is because by 1700, both Jamaica and Barbados became significant producers of sugar. Moreover, the English had found few traces of precious metals in the parts of America which they initially colonized. This meant that the islands (or inland settlements) that they did set up tended to be far more focused around agricultural activities. By the mid 1600s England was in possession of both Jamaica and Barbados. As a result, sugar would become the defining feature of the islands; shaping their future and acting as a precedent for the development of other Caribbean islands in later years. In order to show that society and agriculture in the Caribbean experienced change after the introduction of sugar into its economy, it is useful to make a brief summary of the condition of both areas before continuing.

These events have been chosen because although in time terms they are every four years etc. each time the sporting occasion arises it is held within a different city as compared to an event such as Wimbledon that is held on a yearly basis in London. By holding the Olympics in a different host city each time the event occurs, it creates a large amount of pressure on the host city as compared to Wimbledon that is held in London year after year and therefore London recognises the pressure and effort that is to be expected and can adapt for what is required.

Illustrate your answer with a case study.,"Aside from Indiana Jones-esque discoveries of treasure hoards, the aspect of archaeology that most captures public interest is surely contact with physical remains of people from the past. Seeing the bones of a person who lived hundreds, even thousands of years ago, makes us feel a strong a connection with the past, and reminds us of our own mortality. Archaeologists expend much time and effort on studying human remains, due to their significance in interpreting sites and drawing conclusions with far-reaching implications. When remains have been deliberately disposed of by a society, they can perhaps tell us just as much about the living who performed the disposal as the deceased. A body can inform us of society's attitude towards that person, members of their society once dead, and death as a concept. Prior states that for all of us, the body is 'our most fundamental source of contact with death' and explains that it is 'not merely an object over which people vent their emotions but also one which is utilised to convey a representation of death' <fnote>Prior, 1989:21 </fnote>Bodies can be incredibly rich sources of evidence for many aspects of life in the past as well as death.

Yet despite this, 'the intensity of the debates about memory and the Holocaust has never abated."" The task at hand is perhaps even more disdainful because it is expressed in a normative statement, and seemingly, it beckons to the writer to take part in a doomed enterprise.

BAWE,BAWE_169,Review of the Main International Relations Theories,"This essay will first outline the main assumptions and tenets of the liberalist, neo-liberalist, realist, neo-realist, and the different Marxist approaches to the study of international relations. Having done this groundwork it is hoped that a personal conclusion will be reached about whether there is a theory that competently deals with international relations and its many constituent parts. The exclusion from the analysis of international society theory amongst other constructivist and reflectivist approaches does not reflect disregard for the considerable achievements this approach has made, merely an acceptance that there is only so much one can cover in two thousand words. Liberalism's central concern is the liberty of the individual. It posits that the main determinants of world peace are: open state governments which are responsive to the needs of its individual citizens; inter-state governments which could help safeguard the rights of these individuals; international cooperation which would foster a sentiment of trust across all national boundaries; and finally free trade which would further entrench the notion of a shared purpose between countries. <fnote>Baylis, J., Smith, S.

Foucault claimed that the traditional view of the author was simply a modern construction seeking to exalt the author to an omniscient position. However, he felt that in reality the author has no authority over their text, as the reader cannot know the author and therefore cannot interpret the author's intentions. Moreover, he felt it was unnecessary to know the author's intention; what was more important was for the reader to be able to bring their own meaning and interpretation from the text for their own use. Other Postmodern thinkers have taken this idea further, treating the world as a text and the individuals habiting the world as the readers. The individual has no clear authority or standards by which to interpret the world and is consequently left to discover 'truth' for themselves, and to live in a way which best serves themselves and their needs. Sigmund Freud thought that in view of death, the central motivation for the individual in life was the feeling of desire and pleasure.

While it has been asserted that humanist thought centred around the capabilities of the human as gifts of God, as opposed to the middle age view of man as 'a humble, fallen creature under the permanent curse of original sin', the unity of the humanist agenda has to a large extent been exaggerated, and the various strands of humanism across Europe 'do not appear to have adopted a coherent position on matters of substance'. What does emerge upon careful assessment, though, is a general set of new attitudes and principles, often contrasting those of the medieval scholastic movement which is shared by both the humanist and reformer. Moreover, a careful assessment of the general theological position inherent in most of humanist thought must be contrasted to that of the reformers' movement to come to a fuller appreciation of how humanism came to influence reforming thought and vice versa. <fnote>Noel L.

BAWE,BAWE_341,A critical examination of the contribution of foreign aid to the alleviation of world poverty in the context of the consequences of globalisation,"<abstract><heading>Abstract. </heading>Globalisation has contradictory effects. It can boost wealth but also lead to more poverty. While accepting that overall, globalisation might have potential for poverty reduction, the paper will focus on the negative impact of economic globalisation on world poverty and the extent to which foreign aid may alleviate this negative impact. Globalisation (i.e. the spread of market capitalism) accentuates poverty and social inequities instead of being the medicine to cure these problems. This is due to the fact that the economic processes of globalisation undermine national states to provide social public goods. Globalisation has a negative impact especially in developing countries since they do not have the prerequisite to access its benefits. Consequently, it generates just another call for aid (development international assistance). However, aid is generally perceived as ineffective in terms of poverty reduction. Moreover, as in a vicious circle, in the 1980s, aid economic conditionality (as in the form of SAPs) reiterates the neo-liberal requirement for liberalisation, which may bring economic growth but do not actually reach the poorest. Foreign aid (as it is presented by the 'Washington consensus' institutions), being conditioned by trade liberalisation and structural reforms, is only making things worse since the recipient states...",You are a university student.

The proportion of boys committing and being sentenced for crime far outweighs the number of girls. In 1999, whilst a quarter of young men had offended, only one in 10 young women had (Flood-Page et al 1998/1999 :55). In the past this differentiation as been unrecognised, but more recently research has attempted to explain what accounts for the differences in offending between girls and boys. In this essay I argue that there are differences in offending patterns between girls and boys and these result from gender based influences (impact of attitudes) rather than differences in sex (biological aspects) (Heidensohn 1989 :88). The evidence to support this argument is split into three categories. Firstly, different attitudes to bringing up boys and girls - boys are allowed to be boys (Worrall and Hoy 2004:190), whist girls must conform to models of femininity (Hudson in Cain 1989 :197).

More recently however, the actions of humans during this prehistoric period have been thought to play a vital role (Behre 1986). The soils of any given area have proved to be very important for agricultural communities throughout history and pre-history. The exploitation of the soils that has taken place has a huge effect upon the soils of Great Britain now and has throughout time (Thomas 1990). Direct and indirect evidence such as pollen diagrams, aerial photographs, geophysical surveys and chemical soil analysis can be used to suggest ways in which the soils have been exploited in the past. Soils have been used to show patterns of prehistoric agricultural development by interpreting the formation process of soils in archaeological sites (Wilshusen and Stone 1990). Due to the importance of archaeology in the quest to find the effects of prehistoric Man on present-day soils and the importance of soils, in any study of prehistoric settlement, a great deal of agriculture involves pedology or the study of soils in their natural setting (Wilshusen and Stone 1990).

Both these doctrines, although established concepts of English Contract Law, have their critics and supporters.

In the four thousand years since the Babylonians solved the quadratic, the cubic and quartic were solved towards the end of the Dark Ages and the Renaissance respec-tively and there were numerous researches into polynomials.

As with other industrialising countries this brought with it many problems such as poor working conditions, long hours and a move from the countryside to more urban areas. The reason that this caused such radicalism in the Russian labour movement particularly, and not to such an extent in the rest of Europe, can be attributed to many factors. Rebellious traditions, an oppressive regime which seemed to give more freedom with the October Manifesto but then took it all away again, and the presence of a revolutionary intelligentsia all contributed to growing radicalism in the labour movement. Firstly I will look at the effect of industrialisation and a Marxist theory attempting to explain the revolutionary tendencies of the Russian labour movement explored by the historian Christopher Read. Some Socialist Soviet historians believed that the radicalism came from two types of worker; 'advanced' and 'backward'.

Operant conditioning has begun to be recognised as a valuable animal management tool to gain the voluntary cooperation of the animals in question (Laule et al., 2003). Underlying operant conditioning is the principle that behaviour is determined by consequences (Laule et al., 2003). This involves two basic alternatives - positive and negative reinforcement. In simple terms, positive reinforcement involves rewarding an animal for an appropriate response to a cue (Pryor, 2002; Mellen and Ellis, 1996). Negative reinforcement involves an animal giving a correct response to avoid something unpleasant (Mellen and Ellis, 1996; Pryor, 2002).

On the other hand, the new regulations are perceived by many as key, as they objectify a possible answer to a major problem in UK industrial relations - the 'representation gap'.

We acquire motive through drive, where drive is simply an internal force that produces motivated behavior. (Ellis and Dick 2000) It has been stated that reward and control, are two broad categories, which attempt to explain the motivation of people to work hard; Hobbes stresses the importance of the reward, where Taylor argues that workers only work for an economic reward and thus, strict control is needed.

Moreover, Culture can be looked upon as a reward of work (Peters and Waterman), where he sacrifices much to the organization and culture acts as a form of return on effort. (Oxford University Press 2006) Thus, strong culture under effective leadership, where managers act as culture carriers, can lead to financial success and sustainable competitive advantage of company, while individuals are able to gain intrinsic and extrinsic...",You are a university student.

Whilst it provided a powerful response of workers to the repressive character and 'determination [of the Polish regime] to maintain [the political and economic] systems, whatever their human costs and lack of legitimacy', an important questions comes to mind. Where from came this powerful articulation of demands, and of 'the most powerful, sophisticated and advanced working-class movement yet seen, certainly in the 'communist' sphere and perhaps anywhere in the world'? To answer this question, it may be fruitful to study the emergence of new class societies in Eastern Europe, paradoxical when matched with Marxist thought. Economic and political developments throughout the 1970s united with a blend of national-historical and wider Eastern European economic grievances to prepare the ferment for 'a new generation of protesting workers with a clearly different way of articulating their grievances [as] a strictly Polish phenomenon'.

However, there are those who claim that globalisation is not as new a concept as purported.

What role can doctors play in addressing inequalities in health and how effective are they likely to be?,"Health inequalities are the systematic differences in health and illness that exist between individuals within a population. In the UK they were first seriously addressed with the publication of the Black report in 1980 1, the recommendations of which were largely ignored by successive Conservative Governments. Following their election win in 1997 the New Labour Government commissioned Sir Donald Acheson to revisit health inequalities, and the report 2 he delivered in 1998 has proved pivotal in attempts to address these problems. Health inequalities have complex and interrelated causes, and whilst numerous theories have been developed to try and understand them it remains unclear just which considerations are of primary importance. However what is clear is that you are more likely to be disadvantaged in health terms if you are also disadvantaged in socio-economic terms. Some health inequalities are likely never to be resolved because of their essentially genetic nature e.g. higher male mortality in cardiovascular disease. But in the main, many health inequalities are a direct consequence of socio-economic circumstance and demand both a greater understanding of their aetiology and effective action to reduce and eventually, eradicate them.

Of great concern is the destruction of the world's tropical forests. This is of particular relevance to non-human primates, as approximately 90% of all primate species are restricted to tropical forest habitats. It has been demonstrated that human population growth is linked to global deforestation and that 'human population pressure is the best predictor of tropical deforestation rates'. However, there are non-anthropogenic factors that influence non-human primate distribution and abundance, and these natural species characteristics are important too.

Discuss.,"The traditional images associated with nineteenth-century colonialism are that of the heroic explorer and solider conquering uncivilised land, and subsequently of the missionary sent to 'rescue' the heathen population through the word of Christianity. One seldom associates established images of the Empire-building project with women in any respect other than as the wives of those who lived in the colonies. Yet to view Empire, and the politics surrounding it, as a wholly male 'space' is to underestimate the role played by the female population. In terms of both the 'coloniser' and the 'colonised', women played a critical role in helping to define both the purpose and the need for colonial venture. The liberation of a downtrodden and oppressed native female became an integral part of imperial rhetoric justifying the European presence. Though often indirectly, the women of the 'mother country' were part of what helped to maintain and propagate this image. European women did not all, however, play a supporting role in the politics of Empire, and some were openly critical of the policy of imposing not simply European presence but also European culture upon these little understood lands.

In the second half of the investigation the editorials of the chosen newspapers will be analysed and used in the same way. By finding inconsistencies between the initial hypothesis and the two sets of analysis it is hoped that the model can be refined or rejected, and a satisfactory conclusion be generated. The first part of the hypothesis is based on the assumption that newspapers have two vested interests when reporting and analysing events, the primary one being economic and the secondary one being political. The economic interest dictates that newspaper journalists, under the gaze of the editor, project their core readers' political predispositions onto events, so as to colour the reports and analysis in such a way that their readers' views are reaffirmed.

Traditionally, until the 1970's, a dispersed settlement pattern of rectilinear structures accommodating extended family groups were thought to have adopted stable mixed farming practices, domesticating animals and crops.

The extinction of species, the depletion of the ozone, the annihilation of the rainforests"" (Roszak, as cited in Reser, 1995, p.237).

However, before attacking the elements of this play that qualify it as an example of naturalism, I feel the need to explore this term further, in order to form a central understanding of what 'naturalism' refers to. At its most basic level, naturalism may be defined as a movement in drama at the end of the nineteenth century calling for an end to romanticism and advocating a new type of realistic drama that would reflect social and scientific developments. Understanding the characteristics of naturalism on stage, however, is a rather more complex. The idea that became the catalyst for the development was that of the scientific method as the key to all truth and progress, a belief grounded partly in Charles Darwin's 'The Origin of Species', and firmly rooted in the works of Emile Zola, the leader of the naturalist movement. Developing Darwin's argument that, ""...human behaviour, when viewed as a product of hereditary and environmental forces, came to seem determined by factors largely beyond any individual's control', Zola thought that the dramatists search for truth should be achieved using the same method of detachment as a scientist,...",You are a university student.

First of all Descartes argues that the mind and body are two distinct things, depending on the cogito ergo sum only. I know I exist because I think I exist, as long as I'm thinking I'm certain that I exist. Therefore, my mind is simply a thinking thing, and this I can clearly and distinctly understand to be true. However, Descartes has negated the existence of all the other substances, he is still not sure of the existence of material things like our body. The existence of our body and any external material to our minds is still open to doubt in meditation six. One thing we are completely sure of is that we, as an intellectual thinking thing exist and our existence as an intellectual being is independent of other external things, as our minds can continue to exist without any other bodily objects and does not depend on other things, like our body.

Often, a male character will perform irrational acts for inexplicable reasons, and is labelled ""mad"" or ""beyond reason"" when social comprehension of his actions is bewildered. Attic theatre has ""two nouns for madness, both feminine, both daemonically personified: Ate and Lyssa."" (Padel 162) Both are external forces that work their influence upon the male interior. Though women are the frequent victims of madness in both the Oresteia and Bacchae, the consequences of female insanity are always rendered as ancillary to those inflicted on the male or the social hegemonies they personify. Men such as Agamemnon and Pentheus, bloated with hubris, have fallible judgement. Irrationality in such characters catalyses their destruction. Madness in females will always have tragic consequences for the women involved, yet it is always celestially ordained; a manifestation either of prophetic destiny or divine wrath directed overwhelmingly at the heroic male.

Introduction</heading>The alleviation of human misery through medical science has an abstract element that transcends the mundane, thus does not lend itself easily to practical analysis particularly in conjunction with legal regulation. This abstract element is contained within moral constraints on the freedom of science and any regulations must balance these two competing interests through carefully constructed ethical guidelines to protect individuals and society and to facilitate research and testing. This essay seeks to ground the debate with an exposition of the controversies surrounding the use of human embryological stem cells in research to better elucidate these abstract concepts and considerations.

Egypt itself was never as unified in its concepts of religion as the Greek city-states were; throughout the country gods and goddesses were identified with different aspects of each other and with different animals.

BAWE,BAWE_282,The Essence of Political Power,"In his 1968 pluralist thesis, Robert Dahl describes politics as the analysis of the nature, exercise and distribution of power; accordingly, a precise understanding of power is vital to all political study. Scholars and philosophers have struggled with the concept of power since Antiquity; debate has focused over whether power can be exercised responsibly, on how it should be distributed, and on whether power can be possessed as an attribute, or rather manifested purely as an activity, in the production of intended results. Theorists further question why people exercise power - while Nietzsche claims that humans possess a fundamental ""will to power"", for Hobbes power struggles are merely fuelled by the scarcity of resources. The complexity of these views suggests that claims that 'politics is power' and that political power exists only within governments are oversimplified.

The English language has been found to consist of a number of varying gender differences, although it is languages of other cultures which are seen to consist of the greatest differences, even to the extreme extent of women and men using completely different lexis to talk about the same thing. In Japanese, for example, the word for 'eat' is pronounced as 'taberu' by women and 'kuu' by men. (Trask, 1999) Although this essay will primarily focus on the gender differences in speech in Britain, it should be appreciated that differences exist in countries all over the world and as shown above, often by far more extreme linguistic features than are found here in Britain. There are three main theories associated with the issue of language and gender. The first, developed by Lakoff, was called the deficiency theory and stated that females speak an inferior version of language compared to men, reflecting the lower status they hold in western society. The second theory is the dominance theory which...",You are a university student. Write an essay on the topic Discuss the differences between males and females way of talking.

We can see from the film how the need to adapt ancient classics for a modern audience in order to make them both understandable and appropriate for modern standards will virtually always prevent the original story from being told without some changes to its content. The way that Satyricon uses various sources and Fellini's interpretation of them shows us how cinematic history can have similar methodology to literary history, which could be used to argue for the legitimacy for a cinematic presentation of history. Satyricon also shows how valuable the visual element of presenting ancient Rome can be, since it can show us differences between antiquity and modern society that could not be put across in words. Finally, the film also shows us how cinema can use ancient Rome to comment on modern issues and ways of life, thus making film an important medium for the construction of Rome in the present.

(Koen Lenaerts). Discuss.,"<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>The European Council is an organ which did not exist when the Communities were first created. It originates from the existing Summit Conferences of the Heads of States which have been held since 1969. It was created in 1974 as a response to a growing feeling by European leaders that the European Economic Community needed stronger leadership to overcome the stagnation in Community legislation and, the financial crises of the early seventies, which showed that ""the Western currencies were so closely intertwined such that national governments could no longer preserve their national economic autonomy"". The urgency to reaffirm the position of Western Europe in an increasingly economically interdependent world confirmed the critical importance of the European Council in shaping Community legislation in a clearer direction. The question, however, is how far-reaching is the scope of the activities of the European Council in the formal Community decision-making process and, what is its position vis-à-vis the institutional framework of the Community. <fnote>""The European Council"", Jan Werts (1992), Elsevier Science Publishers B.V, at pg 60. </fnote><heading>I.

BAWE,BAWE_973,How did marriage alter the public and private identities of men and women?,"Marriage altered the identities of both men and women in Rome, but in very different ways that I will discuss in this essay. It is important to note, however, that most of the surviving sources tell us about marriages between members of the Roman elite, and therefore it is they who are the focus of this essay. I will begin by showing how marriage affected men, especially their public identity. I will then look at how marriage affected one aspect that was common to both men and women, namely their status, before moving on to show how marriage transformed a female's private identity. One aspect of Roman marriage that has been well documented is its use as a political tool. Harlow and Laurence have argued that marriage had little impact on a mans life (Harlow & Laurence 2002), yet while this is true in terms of altering a man's private identity, for members of the Roman elite marriage could have a fundamental impact on their public identity.

BAWE,BAWE_260,Evaluate Marx's conception of the capitalist social order as antagonistic and crisis prone.,"The description in the title of this essay of the capitalist social order as being antagonistic and crisis prone is not a sufficient summary of Marx's conception. His conception does not simply consist of a description of the capitalist social order, but of the notion that it is in fact antagonisms and the tendency towards crisis which constitute the very essence or actuality of capitalism. This dialectical account of the capitalist social order is what distinguishes Marx from other IPE theorists, who arguably have devoted their lives and work to reconciling the antagonisms and crises of the capitalist social order without addressing their causes. Through the use of immanent criticism and historical dialecticism, Marx aimed to expose the actuality of capital, ""not as a totality ossified into a thing, but a living, mobile social relation"". The two words social and relation are key to understanding this conception. For as the essay title suggests, his conception identifies at its foundation, the social basis of the capitalist order. In other words, capitalism cannot be removed from its human source of production and reproduction, and as with all social relations, their essence and being constitutes and relies upon antagonisms and contradictions. <fnote>Desai, M....",You are a university student.

Discuss.,"Archer (2001) claims the reason we 'think as we do today' is 'natural selection has made us this way' (p.414). Reviewing the literature, it seems Evolutionary Psychologists call on Darwinian Theory of biological evolution - that the genes for physical properties which aid human survival will be passed on more than those that do not, because individuals possessing those genes are more likely to survive and reproduce - and apply this to psychological dispositions to think and behave today in terms of survival. This essay will discuss claims made by evolutionary psychologists, as well as various criticisms of their methods. I will focus mainly on the issues of attraction, mate selection methods and criteria and rape, because these are areas causing controversy amongst academics.

BAWE,BAWE_555,Is Bowlby's concept of attachment theory still relevant for studying social development?,"Social relationships which come about early in life have been thought to play an important role in the social development of humans for many years. During this time, some trends in the ways children are raised have undergone changes; from employing a full time nanny in rich Victorian households, to leaving children in a crèche during the world wars, to mothers leaving work to look after their children full time. The derogatory effects of foisting ones children upon a stranger were of great pertinence after the Second World War, which, in part, prompted the commission of John Bowlby's 'Childcare and the growth of love'. The manner in which infants form relationships with their main caregiver, known as attachment theory, was first advanced by John Bowlby in 1951. For 20 years, Bowlby ran a weekly mother's group at a local clinic, where he made informal observations of a random sample of babies and young children interacting with their mothers. Attachment theory has enabled the clinician to attend to attachment experiences in their own right, not as displacements or derivatives of other motives (Parkes et al., 1991).

Whilst proponents of globalization claim that the phenomenon increases worldwide equality by liberalizing trade, allowing all citizens access to a global market and creating a worldwide 'family' of social and cultural interconnectedness, many others resist globalization on the grounds that it undermines state sovereignty or that it exacerbates income differentials and culture loss within societies. But what really is globalization?

In cities such as Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro Mexico City, Lima and Jakarta these inequalities are represented in the form of slums or favelas. There are various social and economic issues that arise as a result of the favelas. The occupants of these slums who have built their own homes all have different reasons for why they are there. However, there are those who suggest that urbanisation is the result of only one major factor. For example the neo-liberal idea that it is due to purely economic reasons as a result of globalisation.

An outlook on the Argentine Situation, Prospects and Policy Recommendations","<abstract></abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>The analysis of recent banking crises is one of the most interesting fields in international financial macroeconomics due to their negative effects and recurrence, and the difficulties involved in their resolution. Diaz Alejandro (1985), when referring to the financial liberalisation processes started in the 1970s, anticipated many of these events with the catchy title ""Good-bye financial repression, hello financial crash."" Furthermore, during a new wave of financial liberalisation initiated in the 1990s, banking crises have shown more adverse effects when compared with the 1980s 1. In this context of endemic banking crises a number of interesting questions have been raised among policymakers and academics: What are the causes of such crises? Which policies should be pursued when a crisis arises? How can another collapse be prevented once the crisis vanishes? The Argentine 2001-2 financial turmoil revitalised these questions, exposing new issues due to the severity and extension of the distress, as the Argentine real GDP plummeted around 11% in 2002 while credit to the private sector suffered a 39.2% reduction in real terms (Dec-2002/Dec-2001).

During the First Punic War, Carthage attempted to gain power in Sicily, thereby creating opportunities for further expansion in Italy. Unlike the First, the Second Punic war was an effort by the Carthaginians to revenge the actions of the Romans in the First War, and the central aim of the war was to crush Rome.

The system has a hierarchical structure consisting of a core, semi-periphery and periphery. This hierarchy is essential to the existence and growth of the structure. To maintain this hierarchy the core tries to use every opportunity made available by the processes of globalisation to achieve its maximum growth. However, I apply the theories of dependency to establish that this increasing development of the core involves the increasing underdevelopment and dependency of the semi-periphery and periphery of the system. Thus, I argue that the core uses the processes and forces of globalisation not only to achieve its own growth, but also to ensure that the other two categories maintain their position in the hierarchy.

BAWE,BAWE_311,Are Modern Psychologists Still Logical Positivists?,"In order to effectively answer this question, the question of what is logical positivism and therefore what is a logical positivist needs to be examined. The relationship between philosophy and psychology must be ascertained, both in general terms and in relation to logical positivism. This ensures we will be able to ascertain the level of influence that the movement of logical positivism had on the field of psychology and be able to assess whether modern psychologists are still logical positivists. Logical positivism was the name given to the movement born of the Vienna circle, which was formally established in 1926. The Vienna Circle was comprised of mathematicians, physicists and social scientists who shared a common interest in the philosophy of science. The primary focus of interest to this discussion group was to introduce the methods and exactitude of mathematics to the study of philosophy. Whilst the research the members of the circle carried out influenced the direction of the circle, their primary influence came from outside the group in the form of the early works of Wittgenstein (1921). The circle believed that in order to significantly advance the work within philosophy, philosophers should be more scientific in their methods. Learning...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_27,What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Stage Models of Cognitive Development?,"Dividing development into distinct stages has occurred in many areas of psychology, but most frequently in cognitive development of children and adolescents. There has always been disagreement as to whether development should be categorised in stages or whether it is a constantly moving process which never stops. Flavell (1977) suggested that stages in development must show distinct, qualitative changes rather than differences in quantitative ability. He also noted that transition between stages must incur several simultaneous changes in many areas of cognition, and that these transitions should be rapid rather than gradual. Some psychologists have tried to suggest that development is an accumulation of small qualitative changes over time, causing smooth, continuous improvement, called linear dynamics, (Harris & Butterworth, 2002), however most parents and teachers will agree that children's development does feature many sudden periods of growth. There have been a number of stage models of cognitive development in recent psychology, which tend to agree on many points, such as the number of stages and the types of changes, suggesting that each has some merit. Freud famously described stages of development in children, including oral, anal, phallic, oedipal, latency and genital activity, (Harris & Butterworth, 2002), although these were never...",You are a university student.

It appears that the majority of wrongful convictions arise from eyewitness error (Wells, 1993).

There is a natural tendency to treat these figures as straightforward facts that cannot be questioned. 'This ignores the way statistics are produced. All statistics, even the most authoritative, are created by people' (Gilbert, 2001). This does not mean that they are inevitably flawed or wrong, but it does mean that we ought to ask ourselves just how the statistics we encounter were created. Not recently, official statistics have been questioned as to the degree of their validity, reliability and objectivity and whether these are in fact essential. When considering whether sociologists should use official statistics one has to consider whether the limitations outweigh the advantages to using them in accordance with the researcher's theoretical perspective. Many sociologists believe there is an exaggerated suspicion of social measurement and an excessive distrust of officially produced numerical data.

BAWE,BAWE_307,The Social Construction Of Black Masculinity Necessarily Manifests Contradictory Experiences. Critically Discuss.,"Society has always had a preconceived notion of black masculinity. Earlier theories of black masculinity pathologised black male sexuality. (Marriot, 1996) This racist attitude inevitably was at its peak during the years of slavery. Nineteenth century plantation societies saw the emasculation of black male slaves as they were stripped of all the symbols of masculinity - as defined by that society. However, with the twentieth century and the Black Power Movements there rose a different image of the black male as being hypermasculine, and this image became another racial stereotype with prominent figures in popular culture endorsing it. Ironically, much of the tension regarding the hypermasculine stereotype of black men is a logical cultural development for a group systematically denied full access to the socially constructed ideals of masculinity. As Bell Hooks or Kobena Mercer argue, historically the black man was denied the attributes of patriarchy. Whereas prevailing notions of masculinity imply power, authority and control, these were historically denied to black men since slavery. The new black masculinity, which Hooks, Hortense Spillers, Michelle Wallace and other feminists state as patriarchal phallocentrism, is however supported by many black male scholars.

There was an enormous difference in the speed in which the natives of North America were subdued compared to the Aztecs in Mexico. The Spanish first conquered the Aztecs (which took only two years) and then began to settle their people; the Europeans who entered North America first settled part of the land and then instigated the conquest of the continent as they progressed westward over two hundred years. Consequently contemporaries would view the two processes in a different light; Cortez's expedition into Mexico is nearly always called by chroniclers and historians ""The Conquest of Mexico.""

BAWE,BAWE_160,Why is democracy better than autocracy for economic development?,"In the essay ""Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development"", Mancur Olson proposes a theory of how economic growth is related to the development of democracy. Using rational-choice theory as the basis of his argument, he concludes that ""[t]he conditions necessary for a lasting democracy are the same necessary for the security of property and contract rights that generates economic growth"". Thus, Olson does not claim a causal relationship between democracy and economic growth, but that democracy and sustained growth - requiring the same set of institutions - will occur simultaneously. Olson's theory may provide an explanation for why the Chinese economy under Qing rule (1644-1912) experienced no intensive growth at all, whilst per capita income during the same period in Western Europe more than quadrupled. This essay will outline the key features of Olson's argument in the context of China and Western Europe at this time. By contrasting the gradual emergence of democracy in Europe after the fall of medieval feudalism with the ""autocratic"" bureaucracy prevailing in China throughout the Qing dynasty, it will be argued that Olson's theory is indeed applicable, yet not sufficient, for explaining the contrasting economic experiences of China and Western Europe since the late Middle Ages. <fnote>Olson,...",You are a university student.

However, the real stimuli to trade came with the arrival of the French and especially the English East India Company in India.

The final bill was rejected 3 times before the use of the Parliamentary act was used to ban hunting. Since the 2004 ban, it is believed that the ban is a target against the rural communities that participate in the activity. It is claimed that hunting with dogs is the least cruel method for culling foxes, but comes with criticism from the Committee into Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs which have evidence that a dog bite doesn't always initially target the neck of foxes and hares, and the constant pursuit of deer doesn't correlate to natural behaviour. A study on the numbers of foxes during the foot and mouth outbreak proposes the idea that hunting with dogs isn't an adequate way to regulate numbers of foxes. Deer hunting with dogs only accounts for 15% of culling needed. Also, hare and mink hunting make an insignificant impact on the number of the species. Therefore the ban on hunting with dogs can have suitable justification that animal welfare is seriously compromised, and not a conspiracy against the class divisions. </abstract><heading>Introduction...",You are a university student.

This entails looking at food fortification, the process when particular vitamins and minerals are added to a food product, at levels higher than they would naturally be found, to increase its micro-nutrient value. The hope is that by doing so we can prevent the occurrence of diseases and disorders that result from nutritional deficiencies. In addition one might also consider so-called ""functional"" foods, created and marketed specifically to be of benefit to health because of the...","You are a university student.

Chase and Dibble observe only indirect evidence has been preserved and therefore there is no definitive answer (1987), however, a development in the skeletal morphology might have been required to allow a greater range of sounds (Davidson, 1991). Cerebrally speaking, Steve Mithen finds it difficult to believe the early human brain could be equivalent in size to, or in the case of Neanderthals in excess of, modern humans but produce a hominid incapable of speech (1996).

BAWE,BAWE_871,Compare and contrast two 'authentic' texts (spoken or written) identiying some of the choices (linguistic and pragmatic) that 'realise' the particular set of 'goals' and purposes...,"<heading>Introduction</heading>This paper presents an analysis of two texts which have been chosen as interesting from a pedagogical view. The present IELTS exam requires that candidates write either a formal or an informal letter. By comparing and analysing the texts it should be possible to identify a prototypical letter and how choices realised in the texts achieve their goals. As Eggins (2004) states, this kind of contrastive analysis is useful because patterns of choice are more easily identified. Genre and Register theory can enable the linguist to both predict and deduce the likely meanings and linguistic features which are 'at risk' in a text. Genres are realised through structural patterns, or stages whereas the different contexts manifest in the variables of Register. This paper will therefore analyse the texts' schematic structure to highlight how closely they conform to the genre and use Register theory to focus on how the writers convey underlying meaning. Finally the texts are analysed from a pragmatic viewpoint to see to what extent maxims of politeness are followed. The paper concludes with the implications for teaching exam students. <heading>Genre</heading>If we can determine what the social or communicative purpose of a text is, we should also be able...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_946,What impact has archaeology had on our knowledge of the Medieval peasant?,"<heading>Introduction:</heading>Our knowledge of the medieval peasant comes predominantly from historical sources. However, during the medieval period education was not common. It was restricted mainly to the upper classes who would therefore be the ones writing these sources. This generally causes primary texts to be biased towards those of a lower class, in this case the peasants. Therefore the impact that archaeology has had on our knowledge of the medieval peasant is that it allows us to see their lifestyle without the prejudice of an earlier time clouding our understanding. It gives us information that the authors of our historical texts may not have seen fit to write about. I will discuss the various branches of information that archaeology has presented to us. This will include excavation at various sites, field work, and scientific methods such as the investigation into climatic change. All these aspects of archaeology will link together to provide us with an unbiased and factual account of what life would have been like as a medieval peasant. <heading>Settlement structure. </heading>I will begin by looking at the various house types that existed throughout medieval Germany.

BAWE,BAWE_394,In what sense might Metropolis and Der blaue Engel be considered 'modernist'?,"Modernism is surely the most indefinable movement of the twentieth century. As critics have remarked, it is a concept which 'incorporates major contradictions'. However, a key factor in our understanding of modernism is an awareness of the socio-political, cultural and scientific context of its conception. If we are to define it as a movement which, as Peter Childs argues, was 'primarily located in the years 1890-1930', then there are many notable developments which took place in Germany during this period crucial to the birth of modernism. Indeed, death contributed greatly to this birth. According to one website, '1,773,000' soldiers died and '11,000,000 mobilized' and '4,216,000 injured' men arrived home in the defeated Germany in 1914. More positively, the 1919 National Constitutional Assembly elections led to the 'right to vote' being given to women, who, six years later, represented over a third of the working population. Moreover, female emancipation occurred not only in political and professional realms, but also in the sphere of sexual relationships. The creation of 'die neue Frau' was influenced by the 'free sexuality' encouraged by the Berlin and Munich cabaret scenes; in addition, the arrival of sexual health clinics meant that women were no longer confined to...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_11,How useful is it to separate the 'form' of social life from its 'content'?,"Georg Simmel separates social form from social content in order to provide an explicit distinction that allows for the constructive study of sociology. The analysis of social form is built on Simmel's premise that 'a collection of human beings does not become a society because each of them has an objectively determined or subjectively impelling life content' (Levine 1971 24). The importance of the social form aims to provide a firm basis to the study of society and the discipline of sociology thus allowing objective and concrete analysis to be made. This separation attempts to allow one to formulise and structure social theory and society respectively and the complexities of social form in themselves are arguably to such an extent that this explicit separation is warranted. The ideal of sociation therefore is built on the basis of social form and how individual's come together to form a society. However, problems in this division can be argued for. Social form and social content can be seen as inseparable and the standing and usefulness of social form can be jeopardised through manipulation. They can additionally be seen as too constraining on the individual and the discipline of sociology. The separation is useful...",You are a university student.

What are the genetic consequences of dispersal for the individual, the social group, species population structure and conservation?..(""","<heading>Introduction</heading>Natal dispersal, or the movement of organisms away from a place of birth, occurs among a range of species (Brookeral. 1999). Dispersal to a new group may be temporary, or a permanent transfer (Pusy & Packer, 1987). Individuals often go to extreme lengths to migrate from their natal group, e.g. Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) have been seen travelling 60 kilometres to reach new breeding groups (Pusey & Packer, 1987). Long distance dispersal of this nature may be costly both energetically and through the increased risk of predation and potential aggression from strangers (e.g. vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops): Cheney & Seyfarth, 1983; olive baboons (Papio anubis): Packer & Pusey, 1979). Dispersal often incurs locational costs as individuals leave behind a familiar home range (Isbell & van Vuren, 1996), e.g. individuals from a group of red howler monkeys (Aloatta seniculus) suffered protein and phosphorous deficiency due to a poor diet as a result of reduced foraging efficiency in unfamiliar forests following dispersal (Pope, 1989). Primates are predominantly social mammals spending a high proportion of time making fervent bonds and securing relationships with group members (de Waal, 1988). Therefore, the social costs of leaving a familiar family group may also be high. Despite...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_481,Why did turnout decline substantially between the British general elections of 1997 and 2001 and recover little in 2005? Why is there such a strong contrast between the turnout of the youngest and oldest cohorts of voters?,"The British General Election of 2001 resulted in Britain's lowest voter turnout since 1918. Only 59.1% of the population cast a vote, and this increased only slightly to 61.2% in 2005. Considering turnout had never dropped below 71.5% between the years 1970 and 1997, concerns have been raised regarding why turnout has declined so substantially in recent years, and has then failed to make much of a recovery in 2005. It is important to contemplate what may have caused this drop in turnout, and what attempts have been made to improve it.

BAWE,BAWE_1044,Why was virginity such an important theme in Ancient Myth?,"Myths come from the Greek word mythos, which means ""word"", ""speech"", ""tale"", or ""story"". A myth is a story that would have usually been told orally and then written down in the later years. Myths can also be seen on pottery, paintings, in plays and in music. However, there are some scholars who are not content with this definition of a myth, and want to recognize myths that are 'true' and those that could be confused with a 'folktale' or a 'legend'. Myths were used in ancient society as stories, but also as moral situations and lessons as example for society to follow. They were well known to the public and would have been recognised if for example they were acted out in a play. There were many 'lessons' and themes that occurred in myths such as, glorification, rape, male and female relationships, marriage and also virginity. To understand the reason why virginity was such an important them in myths, different areas of mythology will have to be considered.

What policies and practices would characterize such an approach?,"<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>Human resource planning is of crucial significance to an organization for formulating and implementing strategy for achieving its goals. For the past twenty odd years, it is being seen that organisations are trying to match the characteristics of their people with their business strategies (Schuler and Jackson, 1987). Considering that employees play the most pivotal part in making a business successful, when expansion or growth is aimed at as a part of business strategy the personality traits, skills, perspectives, ability, values and knowledge of employees become crucial.

BAWE,BAWE_640,To what extent are the concepts of 'temporal discounting' and 'risk aversion' useful outside the laboratory?,"Temporal discounting and risk aversion are both phenomenon found in the laboratory when investigating how and why people make certain decisions. Decision making consists of choosing from between various options and with each option there are generally associated benefits and costs. It used to be thought that people behave rationally and therefore would select what would rationally be the best option. This assumption is what normative theories of decision making were built upon, for example utility theory as proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern argues that we try to maximise expected utility, by assessing the probability of an outcome occurring and multiplying it by the utility (the subjective desirability) of that outcome. However it was soon realised that people do not make decisions in a rational manner and are often affected by factors other than expected utility (Eysenck & Keane, 2005). People tend to violate the criterion set by utility theory as they give more value to certain outcomes than to uncertain ones and also tend to have different attitudes towards gains and losses. To cope with this inconsistent data, new theories were developed such as prospect theory as put forward by Kahneman & Tversky, this theory proposes that peoples...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_1078,How might we explain the ongoing fascination with the figure of Helen of Troy? Discuss in relation to one or two post-classical re-workings.,"In today's society, as in that of Ancient Greece, the name 'Helen of Troy' symbolises the epitome of female beauty. One of the few female characters in the Iliad, an epic dominated by men and their concerns, namely war, Helen remains something of a mystery to us. While the written sources agree that she was the most beautiful of all women, they contradict each other on almost everything else about her. Her personality and the question of how much she is to blame for the Trojan war has been disputed throughout antiquity and the more recent past. With so little about her known for certain, just how has Helen continued to fascinate western authors and audiences for so long? To consider this question, I shall use classical sources in conjunction with the recent novel 'Troy', a reworking of the Iliad for older children and teenagers. Spanning the final days of the siege of Troy, the book is written from the viewpoints of young Trojans, newly added characters, as well as the figures present in Homer. Perhaps the continued interest in Helen can be attributed to the varied ways she is presented in Classical epic poetry. Helen's first appearance in western...",You are a university student.

In some 1600 pages of published material, representing barely more than half of its projected size, Musil's unfinished work presents the reader with an incredibly complex and highly philosophical contribution to modern literature. Written over a period of two decades, the book reflects Musil's own philosophical and spiritual ambitions, offered in the story of its hero, Ulrich. The setting is Vienna, in the year just prior to the commencing of World War I. An iconic picture of the modern world, a wide cast of characters surrounded by the accelerating advances of impersonal technology variously respond to the apparent lack of a meaningful principle by which they can anchor their lives. Ulrich, a gifted man of remarkable intelligence, but mirroring the formlessness of the world around him, finds himself completely removed from any definite construction of his own identity, and so exists as the man without qualities.

It is rarely out of the news and has become a marginal but dangerously significant part of the current British political culture. Arguably the BNP is a single issue party focussing on questions of immigration, asylum and race. Its recent prominence can be seen as part of the wider revival of fascism in Europe and America faced with the problems of globalisation and terrorism. In the 1980s and 1990s the death of fascism in Britain was being heralded by many as the decline of the National Front was seen to indicate the British public's final rejection of fascist ideology. The popularity of the National Front during the 1970s meant Britain was considered at the forefront of the Far Right in Europe. However, the organisational and ideologically splits of the eighties destroyed this fascist movement. Paradoxically, during this same period continental Europe especially Germany and France were experiencing a substantial rise in neo-fascism both underground and through electoral success.

Descartes justified this claim by asserting that by definition, God was a supremely perfect being, and that existence was a quality that was necessary of such a perfect being. According to Descartes, all the infinite perfections formed a coherent and undeniable unity in any notion of God. However, one of the objections to the Ontological argument was that 'exist' is not a predicate. Since Immanuel Kant, proponents of this notion have argued that existence is not a property of objects and could not be regarded as a feature they can possess. If this belief is true, it would have to be conceded that existence can no longer be ascribed to any notion of God as part of the description of him because existence would cease to be a perfection to be unified necessarily with the other perfections in the idea of God.

Spearman (1904, cited in Deary 2001) first described g after finding several different mental abilities were positively correlated, and inferred from this that there was some underlying general factor that was influencing different abilities. This theory has been taken and developed in various ways by different psychologists over the past 100 years, but this approach has not been without it's dissenters, and there has been significant opposition, for example by Gardner's (1993) claim of multiple intelligences. Rather than being dismissed, these detractors should be answered, and unfortunately this has not always happened in this debate. The case for a theory of general intelligence can be supported by research and theories from many areas of psychology. Firstly, there is the evidence from psychometric testing, and basic level cognitive task studies such as reaction time.

The mere presence of it within our homes be it, mud from a shoe on a once pristinely white carpet or something less obvious such as a sock on the kitchen table often leaves the observer with feelings of anguish at its inappropriate positioning.

Many sceptics claim that money permeates the entire political system, especially in two key areas, election campaigns, and interest group influence. These claims are backed up by some incredible statistics.

Although it is incredibly difficult to prove that money is the overriding influence in US politics (although the upcoming trial of Jack Abramoff could make this inference more accurate) it is widely regarded as true that, without money in US politics, you barely stand a hope of influencing the system in any way, and exceptions to this rule are highly sporadic.

Among these were many workers both skilled and unskilled who were unable to support their families and heavily reliant on the state for support. Working-class pressure in this context mainly constitutes Trade Union groups and Left-leaning political parties that claim to represent working-class interests. Nonetheless, as Salter (Salter and Stevenson 1990) argues there is a distinction between the attitudes and behaviour of working-class members and the organisations that purport to represent them. Moreover, working-class expression is more than just the Trade Unions or Social Democratic parties; it also involves lower-class women, the unemployed, non-union workers and the conservative and liberal working classes. However, due to time constraints this essay will mainly focus on Trade-Unions and Social Democratic party activism as the major sources of working-class political expression.

However, this essay will also attempt to establish whether it is possible, qua reader, to sympathise with or understand Emma's decision and whether, in fact, this chosen lifestyle is merely a dangerous one. Emma aspires to a life which is well beyond her social class. She will only accept the love which complies with that which she reads about and Flaubert uses many examples to demonstrate how this can be extremely dangerous. She constantly lives in a world which is unreal and, according to Flaubert himself: ""Madame Bovary herself was to be a woman of perverted character, a woman falsely poetical, of false feelings."" Emma is ecstatic when she is to marry Charles and thinks that all her dreams will become reality.

BAWE,BAWE_304,"Supporting your argument with detailed examples, identify and explore which of the movements we have covered on the course has made the greatest contribution to innovations in performance.","On the 20 th of February 1909 the first futurist manifesto was printed in the Italian daily circulation 'Le Figaro'. It's author Filippo Tommaso Marinetti had written it from a luxurious 'Villa Rossa' in Milan and pointed to the Parisian public as the target of 'incendiary violence.' Although Paris, enjoying its title as 'cultural capital of the world' was regularly a victim of attacks on the establishment the manifesto showed radical ideas of performance the world had never seen before. Marinetti had lived in Paris from 1893-1896 and had enjoyed living in a circle of friends involved in the arts. Amongst these friends was Alfred Jarry. Marinetti was heavily influenced by Jarry's controversial attitudes to the theatre and many of his ideas for futurist performance can be seen in Jarry's play 'Ubo Roi.' 'Ubo Roi' debuted at Lugne-Poe's Theatre de l'Oeuvre on the 11 th of December 1896 and was modelled on schoolboy farces and puppet shows. The play was a curious ensemble of ideas, which Jarry set up in the preface. These ideas were often contradictory to stimulate the audience. Jarry wrote how Ubo was to wear a horse head of cardboard 'as in the Old English theatre'. This...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_430,What conclusions should one draw about the 'self' from Goffman's work?,"Erving Goffman, writing in the post-war period, is one of the last century's most acclaimed sociological writers. The accessible style of his work has made it some of the most widely read, providing insight into the vast symbolic significance of social interaction. Characteristics shared with Simmel's style of essayism are clear; Goffman's assertions, like his, are not generally backed up with empirical evidence. This is not necessarily a criticism however, as it allows his style the charm that has made the pieces so popular and comprehensible. Goffman's work hinges on the notion that 'all human beings are vulnerable to the constraint of social interaction' (Fisher and Strauss, 1979, p.479). As a result, his work is often cited as part of the Chicago school tradition of symbolic interactionism. Their concern was to investigate those social actions that have an 'immediately reciprocal orientation' (Joas, 1987, p.84), on the basis that such actions have a symbolic character. Mead's conception that individuals partaking in interaction both give out and receive gestures and signals, was one important work to come out of the Chicago school, which one would perhaps tend to associate as the basis of Goffman's concern with the construction of 'self'.

BAWE,BAWE_477,"The Decline in popular participation in Britain highlights the changing nature and focus of democratic participation in Britain today"". Discuss.","The decline in voting in Britain, at all levels of government, has given the impression of a decline in popular participation, and seems to suggest an apathetic electorate who do not care about becoming engaged in politics or democracy. However, to infer this simply from studying electoral turnout ignores the multiple 'entrance points' into modern politics, which allow for people to become engaged in democratic participation in non-traditional ways. Although there is a decline in voting, interest groups especially single issue groups, are flourishing. There is also an increasing trend of participating on an individual level; activities such as boycotting certain products, or buying fair trade goods. This reflects the changing nature of democracy, not just in Britain, but in the world as a whole. With increasing consensus in 'Westminster' politics, and Britain as a whole, on traditional economic and welfare issues, there has been a shift towards participation on behalf of 'post-materialist' issues, which has shaped this change in the way we participate, and the focus of participation. Democratic participation is no longer being exclusively exercised at the polls to influence Westminster; people are using their wallets and social conscience to lobby for change at a local, national and...","You are a university student.

Are these useful in practice?","Weber tends to reject the type of over-arching theory of historical development that others, like Marx, favour, and thus it follows that he also rejects the idea that class relationships can have ultimate, universal supremacy. This led to the development of an approach that views social stratification as made up of three conceptually distinct elements: 'class', 'status' and 'power' (or 'party', as the term used in Weber's work). Weber viewed all three dimensions as 'phenomena of the distribution of power in a community', thus emphasising that power is not only struggled for on economic grounds but can also be valued ""for its own sake"" (Weber, 1966, p.21). He makes clear that while social honour and 'prestige' is often tied in with the struggle for power, it is not a necessary feature when that power is economic or political. Thus it is essential that these dimensions of power, in the economic order ('class'), in terms of honour (status), and over man (party), remain distinct. Weber's definition of 'class' incorporates all of those who share the same 'class situation', this being the level of opportunity a person has to purchase particular goods and to achieve certain living conditions and life experiences (Craib,...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_36,Did Darwin's Theory of Evolution Counter the Romantic View of Nature?,"Charles Darwin provided the first explanation for the means by which evolution takes place. This was by the process of natural selection. A key aspect of Darwin's ideas was that species were not immutable, that they could change in their essential characteristics. It had been a common belief that species were immutable because of the writings in the Bible. Genesis mentioned the species that God had created and it was assumed that only God could create new species. Darwin was worried about the implications of his ideas. In January 1844 he wrote to J. D. Hooker claiming that it was 'like confessing a murder' to suggest that species were not immutable. However, many of Darwin's ideas had been in discussion by earlier natural historians and Romantic thinkers in the decades before he published his Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection in 1859. Romanticism began in the mid-eighteenth century and reached its height in the nineteenth century. The Romantics questioned old beliefs, requiring proof before they believed in something.

BAWE,BAWE_815,An analysis of the formal features of Aphra Behn's 'Song: ~On her lovin two equally',"Aphra Behn begins this poem by relating the narrator's passion to a stream, through the use of metaphorical language. The second line creates an image of a fork in the stream as it splits into different, but equal courses. This appropriately summarises the theme of the poem; the narrator has to decide on a course to take, meaning she has to choose either Damon or Alexis. In terms of rhyme scheme, the first and third stanzas consist of three rhyming couplets (aabbcc). This type of rhyme scheme is sometimes referred to as 'metrically accelerated rhyme' - the rhyme words are as close together as possible, speeding up the pace of the poem. The fast pace suggests a rapid stream of thought as the narrator, or persona, tries to make sense of her complex situation. The rhyme scheme changes to ababcc in the second stanza, and consequently there is a break from rhyming couplets. This highlights the unexpected sound of 'mourn' at the end of the second line. The idea of mourning is central to the poem, as it helps relate a sense of longing and sadness.

BAWE,BAWE_39,Are there any tetrachromats? Why would we expect them to be women? How would their vision be different to trichromats?,"Human colour vision can most often be described as trichromatic. Having trichromatic colour vision entails having three types of wavelength specific cones in the retina, each of which are maximally responsive to short, medium or long wavelengths of light in the colour spectrum. Short, medium and long wavelength cones maximally respond to blue, green and red light respectively (Goldstein, 2002). Trichromacy is not a uniform feature of human physiology however. Because colour vision is inherited genetically, with medium and long wavelength specific genes being located on the x chromosome, mutations can occur. These mutations can cause a type of colour blindness called anomalous trichromacy, in which the red photopsin becomes slightly shifted (Sanocki, Shevell, Winderickx, 1993). If a woman inherits the three cones for normal trichromacy on one x chromosome, and the three cones for anomalous trichromacy on the other x chromosomes, she will possess two types of red photopsin and therefore have the possibility of four wavelength specific cones. If having four different wavelength specific cones defines tetrachromacy it is highly likely that there are tetrachromats (Jameson, Highnote and Wasserman, 2001).

This is because they feel weak and therefore feel they need to be part of a powerful group and have a powerful leader. The authoritarian personality has shown a trend in personality patterns formed in childhood. Research has found that those who score highly on authoritarianism tend to describe their childhood as being dominated by stern harsh fathers who insisted on absolute obedience. This theory is predominately a psychodynamic one as it is based on the idea of 'reaction formation', as a forbidden impulse is re-channelled into a safer course. In effect these minority groups are used as scapegoats as they are considered to be weak and powerless.

This tragedy was produced as part of the Great Dionysia, held in March of each year.

Discuss with examples from the UK,"Stabilisation policy is ""short term intervention by the Government, either to counter balance some trend in an economic variable or to speed up (slow down) its natural time path"". It is used because economic variables such as output and unemployment in the short term deviate from their long-term natural and potential rates, creating a so-called business cycle. The source of these deviations and therefore the way the Government responds to them leaves a lot to argue about. Keynesian economists, building on Keynes' General Theory in 1936 argue that the economy is naturally unstable and that the economy experiences frequent shocks to aggregate supply and demand. Thus policy makers should use fiscal and monetary policy to stabilise the economy to prevent unnecessary fluctuations in output, unemployment and inflation. On the other hand, classical economists and monetarists, such as Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas argue that the economy is inherently stable and blame bad economic policy for fluctuations. They imply that policy makers should not try and tweak the economy and instead be satisfied if they do no harm. Hence in this essay I shall argue why in theory policy should be used in the economy.

'Passionlessness' was initially an ideology created by men as a form of controlling women and thus society. Without economic or political independence, women could only manipulate the ideology to their best advantage rather than overturning it completely. The ideology meant that, 'middle-class women lost their association with lust and instead were invested with the quality of innate purity."" In addition, 'passionlessness' did not just apply to pre-marital chastity, but was expected within marriage for the first time. The condition of 'passionlessness' in a woman, therefore, became the centrepiece to the ideal social unit - the family.

Sensation is recognised as the immediate and basic experiences which are generated as stimuli fall on our sensory systems, whereas perception refers to the interpretation of these sensations by the brain giving them meaning and organisation (Matlin, 1997). The speed at which a sensation becomes a perception is so great that many people take for granted the way sensations are processed and interpreted by the brain, to the extent that they do not realise any sort of processing is carried out. Questions regarding the information which informs us of what we perceive a sensation to be have been considered for hundreds of years with many different theories being formed. The theories can be divided into two groups: those which outline a top-down process and those which outline bottom-up processing. Top-down processing refers to the way that our brain interprets sensations according to our own knowledge, whereas bottom-up processing involves us understanding the meaning of a sensation purely from the information the stimulus itself provides us with (Gleitman, 2004).

There are, however, many philosophical questions concerning language. What exactly do words mean? How is language related to the world? Many philosophers have attempted to answer these questions by positing theories about meaning and language. I will attempt to explore these theories and will conclude if any of them hold water. There are several uses of 'meaning.' There is meaning as intention, e.g., 'I didn't mean to hurt you,' meaning as importance, e.g., 'You mean a lot to me.' There is also a difference between linguistic meaning and speaker meaning. Linguistic meaning is what the language means itself. For example, the French sentence 'Il pleut,' means 'it is raining.' Speaker meaning is what the speaker intends to mean. So if John says, 'Il pleut,' he means 'it is raining.' Frege was particularly interested in the theory of mediated reference.

The dual role of media in politics is perhaps one of the main features distinguishing the journalist from the political scientist: whilst journalists have an obligation both to stimulate public debate and to accurately report on political events, political scientists must limit themselves to being ""neutral"" observers without actively intervening in the processes they are studying.

Using the key points in this definition therefore, the title of 'first scientist' should be given to the person with earliest records of these practises. The new method can be seen in comparison to customary techniques of obtaining general knowledge at the time, and as a revolutionary way of thinking. The suggested beginning for science is during a period of advancement in a broad range of fields, termed the 'Renaissance' by French historian Jules Michelet and meaning 'rebirth'. This progress, made through approximately the 14 th to 16 th centuries in Europe, was significant in arts, architecture and, most importantly to this discussion, technology.

Factors that influence consumption will be analysed firstly, following by comparison of current income with expected future income, with the help of empirical data. In addition, the different responses to expectation and current income on consumption will be examined with respect to certain groups. A conclusion will then be drawn. Consumption behaviour depends on disposable income Y d, i.e. income minus tax. The higher the disposable income, the higher the level of consumption.

The sum of financial wealth and housing wealth is defined as nonhuman wealth. In contrast, the sum of disposable income is called as human wealth.

Both texts can be defined as 20 th century American literature, although they differ in genre - the former is prose fiction and the latter is a poem. That said, the texts share a number of similarities. Both use techniques that are commonly found in other genres. For instance, prose is often thought of as 'non-poetic', but throughout the passage from Tracks are literary techniques such as alliteration, parallelism, metaphors and similes. In this sense the language of 'Tracks' does not fit the formal definition of prose fiction. Similarly, the form and language of the poem is perhaps closer to prose than poetry, due to the absence of end rhyme and a regular metrical pattern. Firstly, one of the most noticeable aspects of both texts is that they are mainly in past tense. Consequently, both use diegesis, a basic form of narration that concerns telling and recounting, as opposed to showing or enacting.

In a more simplistic manner, food has the ability to ""distinguish and to discriminate, include and exclude""; it demarcates ethnic, class, racial, wealth and national boundaries. <fnote>Warren Belasco, ""Food Matters: Perspectives on an Emerging Field"", in Warren Belasco and Philip Scranton (eds.), Food Nations: Selling Taste in Consumer Societies (New York, 2002), pp. 2. </fnote>As a result, food has become a useful tool of analysis because it can capture the dynamic shifts in various social identities we possess over time and place. Warren Belasco neatly encapsulates food as a fluid tool of analysis in that ""food...does not merely symbolise or represent in the static sense but rather moves, penetrates and transforms."" Hence it is the task of historians, sociologists and anthropologists to capture this change in its entirety by ""moving beyond food as a metaphor and cultural symbol""; analysing food in the structure it resides in. In effect, food becomes an important subject of analysis when we situate the analysis of food in a social context....",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_917,Economic Essay,"Elasticity is a measure of responsiveness. The price elasticity of demand is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price. One way to measure responsiveness is by using the slope of demand curve (Slope = change in y-axis / change in x-axis). We want to know the change in quantity that results from a £1 change in price. As slope of demand curve is always negative, we are commonly interested in the inverse of the slope. However, there are problems by using slope to measure responsiveness. We cannot compare two demand curves simply by their slopes because the slope of a demand curve depends in the nits in which we measure the price and quantity. We also need to compare the demand curves for various goods but different goods have different units. On the other hand, prices vary greatly. A £1 change in the price of an expensive good produce a small response but £1 change in the price of a cheap good produce a large response. As a result, we have to use another way to measure responsiveness and elasticity is that measure. Price elasticity of demand (η) is...",You are a university student.

(Tim Ingold 1999: ix)</quote>This witty comment of Tim Ingold brilliantly introduces to the main problem, which I will discuss in this piece of work. Archaeology is undoubtedly an important discipline which gives us a 'visual' insight into the history of ancient societies. However, its very nature, being based merely on perishable material remains, causes a serious interpretative dilemma and a relatively narrow perspective, focusing mainly on material culture. Here anthropology comes to aid, filling the gap between the data and their significance for the structures of ancient societies. The relation between these two disciplines is perceived differently in Britain and in America, which needs to be taken into account, since this can affect the perception of some scholars, depending on their academic background. In America archaeology is but a counterpart of anthropology, broadly understood as the study of human activity, in which material culture (the focus of archaeology) is inevitably incorporated as a product of human activity. In Britain on the other hand, these two disciplines evolved separately, the main distinction between them being in terms of data they use for their analysis.

BAWE,BAWE_231,"In what ways, and for what reasons, have theatre/performance makers challenged the formal properties of Realism?","For political playwrights and theatre groups, Realism's manifesto proved irreconcilable to their own doctrine. The inadequacies of a realist form stem chiefly from it's early inception in the 19 th century, where it garnered artistic credibility because of the emergence of strict social and natural ideologies that supported it. The theoretical kudos inferred from the works of Marx, Darwin and Taine fostered such momentum for Realism that it became (and remains) the dominant mode of artistic presentation in theatre. Yet a theory (invariably linked with the Naturalistic movement) that espouses material truth, and the stressed importance of an essentially deterministic natural formation was to be largely rejected by creators of political theatre. It is easy to understand why: the contradictions between the realist and political doctrines are varied and problematic. Creators of political theatre are essentially unable to reconcile a medium that triumphs clinical observation, a Darwinist rationale and a scientific dogma to one that, in essence, concerns cultural intervention, community action and ideological transference (outlined in Kershaw: The Politics of Performance. ) Early examples of realism concern powerless, trapped figures regimented into their suffering by the prescribed determinations of callous natural and social formations.

The compatibility of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) with various fundamental principles of criminal law has come into question due to its overlapping status between civil and criminal procedures. The government presents ASBOs as a necessary mechanism operating within a legitimate system [1]. As the criminal law is a code of norms of conduct, ASBOs simply reinforce this concept of acceptable behaviour in relation to those who have shown disregard for it. Although this perspective is grounded in practical experience, the government, naturally biased towards justifying its own policies to maintain support for future elections, is not necessarily primarily concerned with the principles of criminal law. Consequently, whilst being useful in an informative sense, much of the government's literature on this subject is coloured by political rhetoric [2]. ASBOs embody New Labour's philosophy of 'zero-tolerance.' These measures respond to recognition of the impact of persistent low-level offending, and a corresponding need to address criminal behaviour at its early stages.

BAWE,BAWE_102,How successfully did the Church impose its moral values on society in the period 1560-1640?,"During the transformation from the Elizabethan times to the early Stuart era, the Church of England increasingly intervened in society; supposedly, this prompted a greater compliance to its moral values. A range of sources, particularly the records of the ecclesiastical courts, indicate that a better educated and more godly ministry, alongside newly found grammar schools that inculcated ""right religion in the young"", were ostensibly triumphant at elevating moral standards. For example, the medium-sized rural parish of Terling, the changes it went through allegedly a representation of ""national or even supra-national developments"", had an infant illegitimacy ratio of nine percent in the first decade of the seventeenth century; by the 1630s, this had reduced to only two percent. Nevertheless, the records historians utilise to measure the effect of the Church on everyday lives are limited; they may show an increase in moral standards, but fail to signify the motives for conformity. Villagers may have displayed compliance to the Church- three in four attending the 1603 Easter communion in the diocese of Lincoln- but probably for alternative reasons to religious conviction, such as avoidance of punishment like ""fines, whipping, or imprisonment in the house of correction"".

Although this adaptation would probably have included subsistence strategies, this paper will focus on the possibility of skeletal morphology. Neanderthal anatomy and the reason or purpose for such unusual characteristics has been the subject of debate since the initial find in the Neander Valley in Germany in 1856.

BAWE,BAWE_43,Why are people's memories influenced by their feelings?,"The relationship between mood and memory is a prominent area of psychological study and it has been shown that people's memories are indeed influenced by their feelings. For example, it seems that emotionally charged memories are generally remembered better than neutral ones. In a study where participants were required to recall autobiographical events that they had previously recorded, recollection was better for highly emotional events as opposed to non-emotional events (Eich, 2000). However, some emotions may impair rather than improve memory. Linton (1975; cited by Baddeley, 1997) found a discrepancy between the recorded frequency of frustrating events in her life and her recollection of these events, and inferred that memory selectively preserves pleasant memories and excludes negative ones. These effects on memory can occur either during encoding or retrieval of memories. An example of the influence of feelings on memory during encoding can be seen in flashbulb memories. Flashbulb memories are vivid recollections of the circumstances in which a highly emotional or personal event is learnt (Brown & Kulik, 1977; cited by Matlin 1994). For instance, people were found to have highly detailed memories of what they were doing at the time they learnt of President John Kennedy's assassination (Matlin,...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_589,Value and Labour: the Sociological Significance of Labor Theory of Value,"<heading>Introduction</heading>The labor theory of value occupies a fundamental place in Marx's works. Just as alienated labour is a key theme in his early works, the labour theory of value marks Marx's transition from the philosophical criticism of inhuman capitalist production to the scientific exploration of the capitalist economy system. At first glance, the labour theory of value seems to be a mere elaboration of Ricardo's theory of value, which complements the latter with a dimension of history, and because of this, Marx is often regarded by some scholars as a conclusive figure among political economists. Such a reading, however, does not exhaust the rich implication of Marx's theory. There are two concepts yet to define: labor and value. As these two words could comprise various meanings, from the most concrete to the most abstract. What is their meaning here? What is their relationship and why? Does this relationship apply to all epochs in the history or specifically to capitalist production? In this argument, the author will try to solve the questions above.

This culminates in a frightening ethic of individualism based purely on his impulses, be they positive or negative. The result is that he becomes so involved in himself that he neglects his wife to the point of abandonment, and she dies alone. Of course other characters are involved in this transformation. His wife Marceline and his enigmatic friend Ménalque play particularly important roles, however there is often critical debate over the function and validity of the two as actual human characters. Marceline is variously described by critics as 'spirit of waiting, endurance and immobility' and 'l'honnetete' personified.

Adding vitamins or minerals to foods is promoted as a way of 'enriching' foods, but the need to fortify is also questionable. Arguments for fortification come from many quarters. Relief agencies aiming to provide food aid to areas where people are undernourished, dying from starvation or suffering from diseases caused by lack of essential nutrients see fortification of staple foods as a way to return people health and healthy nutritional levels (Toole 1992).

BAWE,BAWE_511,Critically consider the 'Method of Doubt' as a means of beginning philosophy,"Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy is renowned in philosophical circles as one of the most influential contributions towards the study of philosophy. Through argument and rhetoric, Descartes sets out on a quest to prove to his readers that mind and body are separate and distinct, God exists and that what we clearly and distinctly perceive is true. The seed of all of these grand proofs is Descartes' famous Method of Doubt. Descartes used this technique the starting point of his philosophy. The question of this enquiry however, is to determine whether or not said method is beneficial to those who aspire to embark on philosophical thought. We will need to assess Descartes' approach towards rudimentary philosophy with a strict criterion of validity and plausibility, identifying its faults and weaknesses in order that one will not be led astray if he should subscribe to the Method of Doubt. It is essential to elucidate exactly what Descartes wished to accomplish with the Method of Doubt.

This statement is very true of the nurse's uniform which is highly identifiable by the public and provokes a positive response (Sparrow, 1986), but as midwives strive to take their place as independent practitioners with an equal status as other key professionals (Schan and Cleary, 1996) the contrasting perspectives of whether uniform or mufti is more appropriate for the role of the midwife will be explored. The history of the uniform we wear still influences public opinion of those in the nursing and midwifery profession, but the uniform is only a strong part of nursing history. The uniform we wear serves to reflect the origins of the nursing profession with strong links being made to religious and military orders which were the primary providers of care at that time. Midwives in the sixteenth century practised autonomously and did not wear a uniform, but as doctors increased their case load to include both normal and more difficult births midwives lost their wealthier client base and so the status of...",You are a university student.

Indeed, entrepreneurs are fundamentally marketer and must be able to innovate within, where more successful entrepreneurs are more acute in managing organizational changes, necessary to absorb the transactions. Furthermore, when faced with an opportunity, an entrepreneur must be able to access and gain relevant resources and then co-ordinate and configure them in a particularly appropriate way so that collectively they deliver value in a unique and inimitable manner. Another important aspect is that entrepreneurs must discover and exploit the opportunities that are not being used and it is through competitive advantage that the firm attempts to exploit these opportunities. Thus, even though, the entrepreneurial venture is built from innovative combinations of financial, operating and human resources, the network is more crucial key to the success as it provides resources critical to the firm's competitive strategy, where it will allow the firm to break into new markets during the crucial early stage development of the new business and provide a competitive advantage.

It is a simple way of representing the values of the forces which drive the electrical particles: FORMULA This integral is taken over every particle inside the body under consideration, which can be of any form as long as the distribution of charge is fixed. Here p' (x', y', z') is a particle inside the body with corresponding charge density ρ', volume dx'dy'dz' and hence ρ'dx'dy'dz' represents the quantity of electricity it contains. p (x, y, z) is a point outside the body and r' = √((x'-x)²+(y'-y)²+(z'-z)²) is the distance between p and p'.(See Appendix Fig 1). Green then moves on to considering the Laplacian of the potential function inside and outside the body. I will simply state these values, since Green uses results known from Laplace and Poisson's work, and I find some of his calculations ambiguous despite the fact that the end results are correct.

BAWE,BAWE_822,Discuss the use of Time in two out of the three major literary genres represented in the course,"'Emma' was written in 1816 by Jane Austen and is an example of a 'domestic novel'. It is so called because it is a story about the domesticity of life and the subtleties of interactions within a household. The novel form itself is a highly structured art form which became significant as a literary form during the 18 th century. It coincided with the rise of industrialism and capitalism and also a higher appreciation of the importance of the individual. The novel form reflected this new found awareness and readers began to interpret meanings in the stories. The novel has a set of narrative procedures which are instantly recognisable and these procedures create a regulated structure for the novel which does not exist so strongly in other literary forms, such as the play. The genre of the play is naturally a freer form, with more scope for expression and interpretation as there is not such a strict structure. An actor portraying a character can choose to interpret a character in a number of ways, whereas characters in a novel are more regulated by structure and form.

Should the skull of the baby be fused and immobile, the infant could not pass through the narrow birth canal of the mother. Upon delivery, the skull is often elongated but returns to a natural profile within hours or days (McPherson 2004, URL ) although the cranial sutures remain open to a certain degree into adulthood. For thousands of years, the temporary condition of the infant skull has been exploited for aesthetic, cultural or possibly religious purpose; adults through the use of deforming apparatus, such as bands and cradle-boards, artificially modified the cranial vaults of their children or those in their care (Blackwood & Danby 1955: 173). Possible examples of this practice have now been identified to Shanidar Cave in Iraq, around 45,000 years BP (Trinkaus 1982 & 1983) and eyewitness accounts have been recorded since the time of the Hippocratic Corpus.

We do know that much of Greek religion was secretive and an enigma to the uninitiated even at the time, with widespread secret cults and 'mysteries'. It is also difficult to come to conclusions on 'Greek religion', as the area we now call Greece wasn't a unified country until long after the 5th century BC, rather an area of land on which separate city states co-existed.

She was convicted for murder by the trial court and sentenced to life imprisonment but on appeal, she could successfully plead a psychological condition of 'Battered Woman Syndrome' (BWS) wherein a woman, because of the traumatic stress of living in a constant state of fear, may feel unable to escape from the relationship and may resort to violence to survive. Her charge was reduced to man slaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility and was given 3 years imprisonment which she had already served thereby being released in 1992.

A variety of miraculous births were presented to the Greek audience, most frequently of immortals but special humans showed their almost divine like status through their beginnings. The births make a statement about the person or parents and differ them from the majority who go through the 'normal' birthing procedure. Firstly discussing immortals, there is a wide range of models of birth. Before the established Olympian generation there were others, the Titans, Cyclopes and Hekatonchires (Morford and Lenardon 2003: 54). They themselves had a relatively extraordinary birth, for they were actually born 'twice'. Hesiod describes how this was made possible by their father Ouranos.

Functionalism maintains types of mental states are types of functional/causal states. What tokens of any distinct mental types have in common is the functional/causal role they play.

BAWE,BAWE_223,Whether worker happiness leads to productivity,"<heading>Introduction </heading>Whether worker happiness leads to productivity is an old and controversial topic. At least since the Hawthorne studies, authors and managers have assumed that a happy worker is a productive worker (Roethlisberger and Dickson, 1939).However, many researchers (e.g.Brayfield and Crockett,1955; Vroom,1964) placed doubt on this form, indicating that happiness did not necessarily lead to productivity. Accordingly, the confused views brought what Schwab and Cummings (1970) called ""the development of uncertainty"" with regard to the happy-productive relationship. It is worthy specifying the meaning of happiness. Most organisational researchers have used job satisfaction as a proxy as their measure of happiness. Job satisfaction, indicated by Organ (1988), is linked to citizenship behaviours over which the employees can control. Others authors from psychology areas have been developing measures of well-being, positive and negative effect and emotional state (Wright and Staw, 1999). Thus, the notion of happy-productive relationship is separately discussed with reference to two connotations of happiness. One refers to a satisfied state brought by work, and the other is concerned with individuals' optimistic traits, in other words, one tends to experience positive affect and emotion.

This was a massive turning point for modern medicine: the battle against infectious disease, which most believed had been won, was not yet over (Sontag, 1990, p.72). AIDS first came to prominence through the appearance of a number of patients marked by the experience of a cocktail of illnesses, including pneumonia, CMV (cytomegalovirus, belonging to the herpes virus family) and Karposi's sarcoma (a skin disease). These cases, initially concentrated in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, were highlighted as decidedly unusual without ""a clinically apparent underlying immunodeficiency"" (CDC report 1981, cited in Grmek, 1990, p.5). From here, Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was born, the latter stage of an infection 'characterised by advancing destruction of key elements of the immune system' (Alonzo and Reynolds, 1995, p.306), and later found to have the HIV virus as its root cause.

Ethnic minorities are concentrated into certain areas of the job market, such as manufacture and communication (Brown, 1992), are most likely to be the victims of assault (Abercrombie et al, 1994), and recent surveys have shown that racist ideas still exist in society.

I shall attempt to display, using a variety of industries where Britain did both well and badly, that Britain responded in a positive manner to foreign competition. Contemporary literature has often seen that the relatively poor performance in Britain is due to so called 'entrepreneurial failure' whereby industrialists made conservative technology decisions.

This is evident in that the Tacitus version summarises the senator's early views clearly in speech whereas the Lyon Tablet has interruptions from individuals who appear to be senators.

In Post-Soviet Central Asia, water has proven to be an irreconcilable dilemma. The legacy of Soviet central planning with relation to water has left severe economic, political and ecological tensions in the region, which the five successor states have yet to solve, and yet, there is only limited time to solve this water crisis. Soviet planning in the 1960s had created a fully co-ordinated and centralised water management system. Though this system was, and still is, an ecological catastrophe, nevertheless, it was easy to manage as a single entity. With the collapse of the USSR in 1991, this system must now be managed by five autonomous and competing states, each with varying needs and priorities for their water. With attempts at co-operation so far having little impact, a great deal of tension has built up surrounding the access to water resources.

BAWE,BAWE_1129,How does religious history illuminate the poems of John Donne?,"'The first thing to remember about Donne,' writes critic, John Carey, 'is that he was a Catholic; the second that he betrayed his faith."" John Donne was born into a staunch Catholic family in Elizabethan England. At this time, followers of this religion were sensible to display an outward obedience to the Protestant consensus in order to avoid persecution. At the accession of James I to the English throne, there was little adjustment to the oppressive, religious framework laid out by Queen Elizabeth in the sixteenth century. While the pacifistic king offered greater freedoms for Catholics, it was clear that Catholicism in England was becoming an old, dying tradition which suffered a severe decline in numbers with the passing of each decade. Donne proved to be no exception to the masses who sought to protect their interests by rejecting their socially damaging roots. Donne's conversion to the Church of England allowed him greater access to employment and connections, which were formerly restricted by his faith, such as his position as Member of Parliament. It would be unreasonable to suggest that Donne abandoned personal, theological beliefs in his decision to leave the Catholic Church, as his passionate concern with his relationship...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_64,Should we be worried about the effects on children of aggressive images on film and television?,"Figures have shown that the amount of time children spend watching television has increased (Hamilton, 1998; Brown and Cantor, 2000; Bushman and Anderson, 2001). Children are considered inhabitants of a world inundated by mass media (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002). A controversial issue is when the content of the viewed material contains violence and aggression. The frequency of this content in television programmes and in films was quantified concisely by Browne and Hamilton-Giachritsis (2005). Results from the UNESCO Global Television Violence study show that 61% of programmes investigated contained violence, 55% of which portrayed violence in a realistic setting. They also report that in 71% of these instances, characters showed no remorse for their actions and received no criticism for them. 42% of aggressive acts reported were associated with humour. Over 1000 violent murders, rapes and assaults are shown on television each year (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002). These statistics are worrisome when viewed in light of two theoretical approaches. The first is Bandura's social learning theory, which has given impetus to the television violence debate.

BAWE,BAWE_299,To what extent did the religion practiced by the Catholic laity change in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries?,"There is immense debate surrounding religious change in the early modern period, accounts differ over its pace, continuity with the past and leading impetus. Jean Delumeau argues that the period marked the first serious attempt to christianise rural Europe by attacking the pagan superstitions that were seemingly rife. John Bossy argues that the period witnessed a shift from corporate to individual Christianity, whilst Robert Birely and Ronnie Hsia emphasise the continuities during the period with the accommodation and retention of traditional religious culture and practice. Despite this lack of consensus, religious practices of the Catholic laity during this period can be identified, and the impact and effect of the Catholic Reformation can be measured. The extent of religious change ultimately, therefore, rests upon what we interpret Catholic practices to be at the beginning of the period, and how these then differed to those at its end. In practice, the change of religious behaviour would appear to be a combination of all three interpretations. Evidence can be found to suggest a more systematic process of christianisation, focused increasingly upon the individual, with the retention and adaptation of traditional religious culture and practice.

Is their assumption valid? This essay will make a critical interrogation of the possibility to apply the concept of cosmopolitan democracy to the European Union.

BAWE,BAWE_444,Japanese Imperialism in East Asia: Obstacle or Facilitator for Contemporary Regional Cooperation?,"<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>This essay argues that Japanese imperialism was a crucial factor in the history of regional cooperation. Wrenching East Asian nations into modernity via economic development and industrialisation, Japanese imperialism left an indelible imprint on the region which remains to this day. The economic interdependency which emerged prior to the Second World War was subsequently consolidated by the post-bellum foreign policy of the United States in order to promote regional stability. From this, cooperation has developed around a core of economic and production networks. This core of functional interdependency still forms the concrete basis from which regionalism in Pacific Asia is occurring today. Despite a proliferation of potentially divisive issues that have abounded since the turn of the century, economic cooperation provides the impetus for cooperation concerning new and increasingly salient issues which are potentially dangerous conflict ridden. Beginning with locating Japanese imperialism in its historical context, this essay demonstrates that notwithstanding the political and military nature of expansion, the Japanese colonial project had a lasting economic legacy which pervaded the cold-war period and to some extent remains today. In the final sections, attempts to institutionalise regional cooperation and the response of regionalism to challenges that are inherent in East Asian...",You are a university student.

Following the war the world economy was met with a slump of unprecedented severity. Coupled with the disruption to international relations and the economy in general caused by the First World War as well as the increasingly protectionist environment around the world, British services were faced with a completely changed climate within which to operate. Although British services began to fall behind their American counterparts, British Market Services kept pace with and even exceeded in part their German equivalents. To an extent this is to be expected, since the British economy was largely open compared to the domestically orientated American economy and more protectionist German economy. However, this general picture conceals the fact that performance in the face of the challenging conditions varied considerably across sectors within services and this shall be examined in this essay.

Spain's weak economical and military situation, the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and the Noticias secretas de America forced the Bourbons to reassess the aims and methods of the Spanish imperial government. This undoubtedly led to the formation of the Bourbon Reforms, which aimed to modernize the Spanish economy, society and institutions. Due to the direct relationship between metropolis and colony all reforms and changes adopted in Spain were transferred to Latin America. However the modifications applied by the Bourbons challenged the traditional and conservative status quo of the colony much to the anger of the three main power groups: the administration, the Church and the Creole elite.

They also point out that home ownership is frequently assumed to have no intrinsic value (Linneman and Wachter, 1989). From these premises, I can crudely extrapolate that when individual choices of housing tenures are not distorted the costs of owning and renting would have to equalize at equilibrium. If they didn't, there would be unexhausted gains from trade. The cost of owning would refer to the annual pro-rated cost of the unit, net of all finance payments, taxes, purchase costs, anticipated appreciation (p.667). This is a very questionable extrapolation, and there are other considerations discussed later that would suggest systematic biases in favour of one type of tenure choice. Ex ante, at equilibrium in the real world, relative costs are expected differ. Therefore the one of the empirical focuses of my analysis could be on testing for differences in housing costs.

In responding to this claim, Socrates outlines his theory of the ideal state and portrays it as a reflection of the tri-partite human psyche. He believes that what creates justice in the state will create justice in the individual. Justice in the state lies in rule by Philosophers who know what is truly good, whilst in the individual it lies in a balanced psyche dominated by reason; something which leads to happiness and is therefore beneficial. Plato has switched the word justice from act-centred to agent-centred and in doing so may have committed the fallacy of equivocation; he is not answering the question that was asked of him.

In order to preserve the status quo between 1834 and 1838, creoles were still bound to plantations through apprenticeship, which in many ways was similar to the conditions they had worked and lived in as slaves. This created great tensions between creoles and the colonial elites and as soon as the blacks were freed from their bondage, most sought to escape the plantation system permanently. Some became peasant and tenant farmers, and those who were lucky were finally able to rise through the social ranks. For example, they moved into the retail sector, become artisans and merchants; some even became white collar workers such as lawyers and doctors and a very few were able to gain considerable wealth and aspired to become as esteemed as the traditional white colonial elites. However, despite this fresh fiscal activity, Guyana remained profoundly reliant on sugar plantations to fuel the majority of her economy.

As Zeus picks up one of the chessmen and moves it forward, Hera's face gets clouded over with a worry towards one of her favourite immortal men, Jason, and meanwhile in the lower world Jason and his comrades in the ship Argo are attacked by a huge sea-monster. This motif of Olympian gods playing a game in the affairs of men, created by Don Chaffey in his film 'Jason and the Argonauts'(1963), is probably one of the most effective illustrations of a popular view towards the relationship between gods and men in the world of ancient Greek myth and epic. In Homeric epic, we are repeatedly taken up and down between the world of mortals and the Mount Olympus and are shown to how the affairs among gods affect men and how they turn the story.

Donaldson states that SLI is a diagnosed when a child presents language difficulties despite this impairment not being associated with any other problems, such as cerebral palsy and hearing difficulties (Donaldson, 1995: 21). A non-verbal IQ of 85 or above is expected of those with SLI in order to establish that the deficits produce by the child are indeed language specific (Leonard, 2000: 10) and that otherwise the child is intellectually 'normal' (Johnston: 1994: 107); however in recent years researchers have felt that the definition of SLI by exclusion is not satisfactory and that non-verbal and behavioural skills are also vulnerable in those categorised as having SLI (Stevenson, 1996: 83). This has led to the suggestion that SLI is not in fact a specific disorder of language but a more general disorder affecting cognition also (Hill, 2001: 167).

While some see this premise merely as a means for the West to propagate neo-liberal ideology, significant evidence suggests that the nature of a state's political regime does have determining influence on its economic wellbeing. In his paper ""Dictatorship, Democracy and Development"", Mancur Olson offers a theoretical explanation for the economic superiority of democracy over autocracy. His argument provides a means of understanding the fall of Chinese autocracy and the rise of democratic Western states since in the Late Middle Ages. One can therefore contrast the impact of democratic and autocratic regimes on a state's economy both on the basis of Olson's theory and through the historical example of the Chinese experience.

The question is whether one can envisage a right to religion without being gender discriminatory, given the history of most religions being patriarchal and opposed to women's rights and freedoms. Certain case studies from India are used to highlight the extremely polarised positions of religious ideologues and feminists that arise in relation to women's rights.

The process by which we use our knowledge to make these inferences is known as reasoning. We use reasoning in nearly everything - from solving mathematical conundrums to finding the way to a particular destination. It is of no surprise then, that the mechanisms of reasoning are of such interest to psychologists. Previous research has led some psychologists to conclude that inferences are drawn through the means of parallel, associative links while others argue that reasoning is based on the application of systematic rules. In an effort to make sense of the gap between these two perspectives, yet other researchers propose that there are in fact two co-existing systems of reasoning. Sloman (1996) is one of the proponents of such a dual systems theory. His dichotomy consists of the associative system and the rule-based system. Sloman describes the associative system as one which operates using similarity and temporal relations. Similarities between objects are used to form correlations and inferences are derived based on an underlying statistical structure.

BAWE,BAWE_38,Why are some children more popular than others and what consequences does this have for psychological development?,"In every peer group, there are individuals who stand out as more popular than the rest. Children are no exception, and different children experience varying degrees of social acceptance from their peers. While some are liked and constantly surrounded by friends, others are ignored or even actively disliked. Popular children are those who are sociable and outgoing. They are included in many group activities, receive many positive peer nominations and are rated favourably. Conversely, unpopular children are widely disliked, receive many negative peer nominations or none at all, and are excluded from group activities (Roff, Sells and Golden, 1972; cited by Elkind & Weiner, 1978). It is apparent that some children are more popular than others; but what exactly causes this? Researchers have identified a number of factors which may affect the popularity of a child. These include physical attractiveness, personal name, dexterity and social skills (Bukatko & Daehler, 1992). Generally, physically attractive children are more likely to be popular (Kleck, Richardson, & Ronald, 1974). Lerner & Lerner (1977; cited by Bukatko & Daehler, 1992) found a relationship between children's ratings of peers' attractiveness and sociometric measures of peer acceptance.

We then move into more advanced areas such as the various characteristic classes. The algebraic topology, which takes up much of the essay, is approached from an algebraist viewpoint. We take time to appreciate the algebraic structure of cohomology including group cohomology although we develop the main ideas in the form of De Rham cohomology from differential forms. We also take a quick look at an application of cohomology to representation theory. After preparing ourselves, we give a sketch of the proof of an interesting theorem we wish to explore. This work is quite wide-ranging and we content ourselves with giving an introduc-tion to the main thread which involves the development of Yang-Mills moduli spaces. The theorem has a corollary that tells us that there are 'exotic' 4-manifolds, which are homotopy equivalent but not diffeomorphic to any complex surface. The essay is presented in three chapters - the first two covering topics from smooth manifolds to cohomology and Poincare duality.

The problem of individuals abusing privileged inside information is not a new one.

A statistical survey in 1971 demonstrated the potential scope of insider dealing.

The food processing industry is continually changing as a result of technological advances and consumer pressures. In industrialised countries consumers no longer require the majority of foods to have a shelf life of several months at ambient temperature, such as that offered by canning and pickling. Changes in family lifestyle, and increased ownership of freezers and microwave ovens are reflected in the demands for foods that are convenient to prepare, and are suitable for frozen or chilled storage. Consumers are now increasingly demanding foods with a healthy or natural image, those containing fewer synthetic additives, or which have undergone fewer changes during processing, and resemble the original raw materials. This is also reflected by the growth in demand for organic foods. Manufacturers have responded by reducing or eliminating synthetic additives from products, substituting them with nature or nature identical alternatives.

Considering that Winstanley was only prominent as a writer between 1648-1652, and thereafter faded into oblivion, there seems to be a disproportionate amount of literature written about him, with little consensus over how we should understand such a complex figure. The most prominent debate revolves around Winstanley's evolution as a thinker- while most agree that he started off as a religious thinker, few concur on his predilections (secular or religious or both) in the Law of Freedom in a Platform (1652). While the question above seems to be fairly straightforward, it is in this writer's opinion that the position one takes in the fore-mentioned debate has bearings on how one would view the nature of Winstanley's religious outlook in The New Law of Righteousness (1649).

Trudgill believes that 'the internal differentiation of human societies is reflected in their language' (2000: 23) suggesting that language is affected by social variables to such an extent that we are able to associate certain language traits with different divisions of people within a society.

The disadvantages of identifying an essence of a given topic have often been argued. My main objection to it, is that the effects may lead us to constrain the way we think about the topic.

BAWE,BAWE_330,Explain the Law of One Price and Purchasing Power Parity Hypothesis and discuss both their economic and empirical relevance. Illustrate using examples,"The Law of one price, LOOP, and Purchasing Power Parity theory, PPP, are amongst the oldest and most important economic theories due to their use in theorems attempting to explain Exchange Rate movements. The relevance and actual evidence of these hypotheses is still the subject of much debate and research. The initial assumptions for both hypotheses are that there are no barriers to trade and no associated costs. The models assume no transport costs and perfectly competitive markets. It also makes the important assumption that arbitrageurs have access to necessary funds with which to trade when opportunities arise. LOOP is defined as being: 'When trade is open and costless, identical goods must trade at the same relative prices regardless of where they are sold.'

In this essay I shall describe how Aristotle conceives living well as living towards the end (telos) and how that end is presupposed in the human beginning. For Aristotle, the formal cause of the human being contains within it the end to which it properly aims. After outlining Aristotle's conception of man's function, I shall raise the question whether man is the only creature who can fail to exercise his function, and show that man's function is essentially ethical, although with the emphasis on a process of self-overcoming. Aristotle's conception of the relation between the formal cause and the final cause can fruitfully be thought of in organic terms. As the seed contains within it the full-grown plant, so the initial organic matter contains within it the full-grown human being. The critical aspect of Aristotle's analysis of the human being is that reason is to be considered as an organic property of the human organism, so the initial organic matter contains within it in potentia the rational human being.

For cinema, mythology provides the audience with pure entertainment whilst simultaneously lining the pockets of the studio heads through box office takings and in many cases merchandising deals that make movies based on mythology very lucrative for a large number of reasons. Mythology in modern film is obviously meant to entertain more than anything else and it does this by transporting its audience into another world, a fantasy world where anything is possible, where the rules of our world do not apply. In these fantasy worlds there is magic, hideous and terrifying monsters, quarrelsome gods, brave heroes, and beautiful heroines that we watch through archetypal stories of good versus evil played out in front of us. In these stories the existence of mythical creatures allows the studios to use an array of special effects to fascinate their audience and...","You are a university student.

The social and private sectors are generally seen as carrying out genuine acts of hospitality, however commercial hospitality can be viewed as having ulterior motives. As Lashley writes; 'In some cases acts of hospitality can be seen as calculative e.g. the business lunch or office Christmas party are not primarily redistributive or undertaken for reasons which primarily value 'generosity and good behaviour as host' (Lashley, 1999:52). However all areas of hospitality have similar requirements. For example as King stated; 'Successful hospitality in both the commercial and private spheres include knowledge of what would evoke pleasure in the guest' (King, 1995:229). Whether or not a commercial host offers genuine hospitality to guests, and the extent to which a commercial host needs to offer 'genuine' hospitality is the question upon which I am going to base this essay.

However it was fascism which took hold in Italy and anti-liberalism which prevailed as the ideology. Benito Mussolini and others like him played on the people's fears about economic and political stability and attracted supporters from many backgrounds. Nonetheless, despite the speed and strength with which fascism appeared in Italy I am going to argue that this was only possible due to the huge divisions within the left and if the left had come together as a united force then they may well have had their revolution and stopped fascism at its roots.

However, on closer examination this assumption appears to be untrue. London was in fact comprised of several smaller organisations, such as companies, who were sensitive to the issues of London's population. Many historians, such as Pearl, argue that it is the sensitivity of these smaller organisations that kept London in order. How did these organisations control London? Was order successfully kept?

However, there's evidence that inequality has been increasing at all levels, from the very macro, being enhanced by processes of economic liberalisation and globalisation, to the inter-local, related to competition and flows of capital and labour, to the intra-local (although reports on increase or decrease of inequality are contested at this level), because of local market dynamics, rural-urban differentiation and social group differentiation (Fuentes, 2005; De Souza Briggs, 2003). Although it can be relatively straightforward to recognise, analyse and therefore try to reduce inequality at the macro- and meso- levels (for example using the Human Development Index (UNDP, 2005); or by means of econometric studies, such as the one conducted by Anderson (2005) on the basis of various independent studies in different countries; or the one developed by Balisacan and Fuwa (2004) for the specific case of the Philippines), many local intervention projects fail to appropriately recognise intra-communal difference, leading to increased inequality, persistent poverty and thus failure to achieve the expected development results (Welbourn, 1991; Chambers, 1997).

Leisure has become an important aspect of life regardless of the factors that influence choice.

As it is not possible to attend to everything in the environment, we tend to inherently select the relevant and filter out the irrelevant. Studies into selective attention generally involve a task in which the aim is to select the relevant information and ignore any distractors; hence a decrease in speed or accuracy would suggest a difficulty in filtering out irrelevant information. However, studies of aging and selective attention reveal various age-related deficits, which also appear to divulge information regarding other areas of ageing. For example, these studies can provide insight into the specific attentional processes affected and the ways in which they are affected. This essay aims to provide a review of ageing literature on selective attention, discussing the experiments and theories that arise from them, illustrating that our knowledge from this type of research can not only provide valuable insights into other theories of ageing but can also help us to improve life in old age.

An indexical is a word that, when used in a sentence, can cause the truth value of that sentence to change depending on the context of utterance. The context of utterance includes the person who says the sentence, the time or place the sentence is uttered and the actions of the person using the sentence. For example, when I say ""I am fat"" it is false, but when a fat person says ""I am fat"" it is true. Even though the sentence is exactly the same, because of the inclusion of the word 'I' the meaning of the individual utterances is different. It is different because the context of utterance was different in each case: two different people uttered the sentence. It is the word 'I' that causes the meaning of the sentence to change, because it always refers to the person making the utterance.

Both playwrights were particularly interested in the idea of determinism and the role that it plays on humanity.

The plays, including such dramatic elements as the characters and scenery, are used as visual representations of the playwrights' study into European society. The female protagonists' interaction with the other characters causes them to realise to what extent life is determined and if there is enough strength in their independence to take control of their own lives. Through Nora and Julie the audience experience the pressures of life present in Europe in the nineteenth century. The finale of each play presents them with the writer's conclusion to the dominance of either determinism or free will.

Natural science studies the natural world in a fashion where there are finite answers.

Therefore, there should be an acknowledgement of the limitations that arise when trying to approach the study of Management using natural scientific techniques.

Although these goods were prized for their scarcity, aesthetic value and excellent workmanship, it was not the material alone that captivated, but more importantly, it was the non-material associations that imbued the goods with meaning, desirability and the label of 'luxury'.

Hobbes' assertion does not imply that the notion of thinking being dependent on a corporeal object should be granted the same amount of acceptance by the common sense of Descartes' day.

We will now examine Descartes' arguments in the Second Meditation to see if they hold up to scrutiny. In the third paragraph (J.

He states that after he has convinced himself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, he still exists because he has convinced himself of something, and in order to convince, one must exist. Although he did not explicitly state it, Descartes has subtly suggested that his existence does not depend on corporeal entities.

Conversely, in the Gorgias, he passionately argues against Callicles' proposal that the ultimate good is achieved by one who creates and satisfies large and intense appetites. This controversy appears to make Socrates out to be a holder of opposing ideologies, offering contradictory accounts of the proper way one should live his life. The reasons for dispute are easy to determine. At Gorgias 495a-d Callicles equates pleasure with the good. At Protagoras 351e Socrates makes the very same claim.

Before that, the price setting relation of wages and other factors of production need to be studied carefully. The general price level of goods and services in the economy is determined as a function of the sum of factor payments, such as wages, rent etc. Since this essay is concerned about the effects on employment due to a rise in oil prices, it shall be assumed that in the economy only labour and oil are the factors of production. Factor payments for labour are called wages and oil, rent (since oil is basically a product of land). It shall also be assumed that the economy is not perfectly competitive; hence there will be a chance to make supernormal profits.

Here I subscribe to the Gramscian idea of hegemony which refers to a state of absolute control achieved through the ready consent of the controlled. It is in the light of this definition that I establish the claim made above. The argument focuses on three countries, namely, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. I begin by examining the control US maintains in these countries through the support it provides to their military strength and internal counter-terrorism machinery. However, this control is insufficient if the US wishes to claim hegemonic status in the region. For this it requires to elicit the consent of these countries (people and government), and the second part of my argument deals with how the ""war on terror"" has prevented the US from achieving this end; thereby, keeping it from gaining hegemonic status in the region. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>Ever since the cold war period the United States has been a crucial actor in East Asia.

What is perhaps most ambiguous is what structural adjustment aims for, recently it has been used as a development tool were initially it sought more to implement macroeconomic reform. In assessing the economic merits of structural adjustment alongside its drawbacks I hope to look beyond the circumstantial evidence to the theoretical frameworks which surround its creation.

Discuss.,"The foundations of the group of historians now known as the Annales 'school' were laid when in 1929 Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre published the journal Annales d'histoire économique et sociale. Since this pivotal moment, the Annales have been credited with undermining the positivist definition of historical fact, destroying the taboo on unwritten evidence, imposing a dialogue with other disciplines, discrediting the history of events, and rejecting the primacy of political history. Importantly, this tradition cannot be attributed to a single historian, nor has it employed a 'clear-cut' paradigm. 'Their work is united, however, in terms of theoretical and methodological principles embodied in the journal Annales: Économies, Sociétés, Civilisations whence their name derives."" Trevor-Roper helpfully captures these elements of unity, emphasising their attempts to grasp the totality and cohesion of every historical period, their conviction that history is at least partly determined by forces which are external to man, and their determination to reduce areas of incomprehension by rigorous statistical analysis. Fernand Braudel's contribution to the Annales tradition, although significant, should be therefore, placed within a wider tradition of conjectural fluidity and development.

He was given the aforementioned title by Herbert Baxter Adams, one of the founders of American graduate training. This anointment was mainly due to his incessant footnoting, his fascination in dealing with archive materials and his use of appendices. However, this attitude has been challenged by a number of historians, who have suggested that Ranke's style of history was not as pioneering as first thought. It is also important to take into account not only whether Ranke's method was scientific but whether this term could also be applied to his historical outlook in general. This essay, therefore, will analyse whether it is possible to classify Ranke as the 'father of scientific history'.

The main question in this conflict between smokers and non-smokers is whether the ban should only include restaurants and bars where food is being served or whether it should also be expanded to pubs and nightclubs (Loreck 2006). Another disputed point of the smoking ban are its positive and negative effects on the economy. However, many countries around the globe have already a city- or countrywide ban, others like England and France will become smoke-free in 2007 (Kielinger 2006).

Afterwards, it will provide arguments in order to demonstrate that a smoking ban for all enclosed public places should be introduced in Germany. It is the contention of smoking-supporters that the ban in Germany should not include pubs and nightclubs, because there, no food is being served and teenager under the age of 16 are not allowed to go there.

Using research evidence, critically evaluate this statement.","The relationship between land prices and house prices is complex, involving the inter-relationship of several contributing factors: the land market; the planning system; new housing production and the housing market. When determining house prices a number of things have to be taken into consideration, such as supply and demand of many different factors, interest rates, population change and movement, construction and production: all of which vary in impact. The economic model of supply and demand, developed by Antoine Augustin Cournot, 1883, attempts to describe, explain and predict changes in the price and quantity of goods sold in competitive markets. It describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between a products availability at each price, the supply, and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price, the demand. This concept applied to house prices show that demand and supply have a huge impact. Land is finite resource as there is only a given amount of in each country.

It is necessary to start with a definition of diplomacy where we distinguish between the actors, the functions and the agenda of diplomacy. Then we proceed with a short description of Cold war diplomacy, as this will also provide us with a theoretical background for further arguments and comparison. An analysis of the evolution of diplomacy thus relies on aspects identified by the definition and aims to elucidate to what extent changes have occurred. The paper discusses changes in diplomatic actors, developments of multilateral and regional diplomacy, evolution of personal diplomacy and public diplomacy, and the shifts in agenda of diplomacy. The most important development occurred in emergence of new actors, new style of diplomacy and evolution of new multilateral agenda. It seems that the major change is the emergence of transnational diplomacy.

Wordsworth's We Are Seven,"Hugh Blair voices an attack on the practices of 18th century poets in his Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres for the circulation of artificial and lofty pieces among the intellectual classes which detached poetry from the concerns of the everyman. Blair exposes the harmful effect on works that are motivated by money and reputation rather than using the imagination with an aim to educate, inspire, move, delight and communicate with the reader. Wordsworth and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads indicated a revolution in literary history in reaction to the poetry created in the Augustan period, favouring tastefulness, elegance and civility. Wordsworth and Coleridge experiment with a new way of using language in this volume, eradicating features of 18 th century poets by composing organic, liberated and passionate verses inspired by real people and concerning real life experience. We Are Seven offers an excellent example of the power of simple and direct language to relate personal emotion and experience that is successful in accessing a wider readership. Wordsworth emancipates the common man into art by elevating the natural to the supernatural, entirely worthy of his glorification.

Connections here refer to the economic, political and intellectual interaction between the flourishing trading economies of Western Europe and Asia during the centuries that served as a pre-requisite to the Industrial Revolution in Europe since the late 18 th century, and colonisation and servitude in Asia. To outline the main stages of the connection briefly, we can say that before C15 it amounted to European explorations, between C15 and C16 it consisted of a two way trading system with the balance of payments heavily in the red for Europe, between C16 and C18 we see European political authority on Asian soils starting to sprout and shaping trading policies likewise and after C18 we see an outright occupation of Asia with its economy being channelled to benefit that of the colonial metropolis. To correctly define divergence, perhaps it is apt to begin by studying a set of figures.

Of course it has not been the sole contributing factor and neither should it be. There have been other influences such as classical teachings that helped to mould the common law in a unique way. But to what extent did Judaeo-Christian theology inspire the development of our English common law and the secular legal profession? How important was such a theology to the evolution of common law and the persons involved? These questions are pertinent. This is especially so because the analysis is located within the context of an encroaching Roman civil law system; inclusive of the strict Canon rules of the church. Therefore the essay will begin with an initiative to define the term 'Judaeo-Christian' in order to frame the essay within a suitable background.

A pure monopoly, which is a single supplier to a market, will not reach this outcome, unlike perfect competition that is synonymous with efficiency. This is because while they produce a level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (provided they do not shut down), as a price maker they will introduce a wedge between marginal cost and the price. Hence the market will no longer convey accurate information about production costs and thus consumer decisions will no longer reflect true opportunity costs of production, as price no longer equals marginal cost, which leads to an inefficient allocation of resources. Essentially, the question we are asking is what are the factors affect the size of the wedge between marginal cost and price?

Humans communicate to let others know our wants, desires and feelings. Interaction is done on a daily basis using both verbal and non-verbal types of communication. Verbal communication entails information transferred through the contents of vocal speech. Non-verbal communication involves any other means of communicating that does not consist of vocal content. In the daily form of communication, occasionally a person might use deception to conceal information they do not want others to know.

(Siegman & Feldstein, 1987, 314) As such, repressed and concealed emotions are likely to find an outlet to release.

Even on a day-to-day scale exchanges are taking place all the time in the form of telephone calls, letters, dances, dinner parties and just conversations in general.

For the police, a confession is a highly efficient and reliable piece of evidence, and is considered as the easiest way of securing a conviction. From a citizen's perspective, questioning by the police can be a stressful, intrusive and intimidating process. Prolonged detention and questioning of the innocent can tarnish the relationship between the police and society. Recent accusations in the media include that ""the behaviour of the police [is becoming] more coercive and imbued with the idea that we are all bad hats until we prove otherwise"". The disgust with which these ideas are reported suggests that society expects a level of fairness and protection within the criminal justice system. Society appears to expect elements of Herbert Packer's due process model to be part of the criminal process, including scrutiny, reliability, equality and the presumption of innocence.

Ideology, as well as other factors including competition for land, caused warfare between the cities of Egypt. This warfare resulted in Narmer of Upper Egypt defeating the king of Lower Egypt and physically uniting the two lands under one king. He united the people of Egypt psychologically by creating one religion based on the gods they all shared. Narmer was once thought to be a myth but work by the historian, Manetho, describes a king that came from the south and united Egypt. His Greek name was Menes and modern Egyptologists have identified him as Narmer, the victorious king depicted on what is now known as the 'Narmer Palette', which was discovered in 1898. The war won by Narmer was an important catalyst in the creation of the Egyptian state, and his methods concerning the organisation of the Egyptian people and their ideology, helped to maintain this unification and prevent further inter tribal strife.

BAWE,BAWE_104,Was European Imperialism a violation or an integral component of liberal ideology?,"European imperialism in the pre-World War era appears aggressive, coercive and plainly exploitative. Indeed, it seems antithetical to liberalism that is embedded on the principles of self-determination, autonomy and individual freedom. However, this incongruity between nineteenth century European metropolitan theory and non-European colonialisation has been accurately accounted for by neo-Marxists such as Lenin. The 'Highest stage of capitalism' theory emphasises that the annexation of exotic territory was influenced purely by economic needs, as imperialism was essential for the very survival of capitalism; the acquisition of materials such as rubber, copper, sugar, tea and diamonds would elevate the income of the rising bourgeois and the proletariat and keep domestic public discontent down to a minimum, an idea amplified by advocates of the social imperialism theory. Interestingly, this interpretation is suggestive of a crucial point: that imperialism is not a direct contradiction of liberalism but liberalism itself is paradoxical. As Raymond Williams highlights, it is a 'doctrine based on individualist theories of man and society' and thus implies that individuals are politically equal, but have the freedom to be economically dissimilar; theoretically, a strange blend of universality and differentiation.

In more broad contexts this greatness can be artistic, moral or physical. The sublime is something that affects you, something that grips you with awe and terror and challenges the minds usual process of understanding. John Usher exclaimed that the sublime ""takes possession of our attention, and all our faculties, and absorbs them in astonishment."" The sublime is an experience we are probably all familiar with.

However, weight control can be an uphill struggle, not only to lose weight, but then also to maintain it. It is proposed that our genes may give us a predisposition to store fat reserves, as evolution has led us to have a natural drive to eat as much as possible when food is available. However, in today's society, where food is so plentiful, it is easy to over consume. There are many biological factors that contribute to weight regulation; homeostasis, certain brain structures, neurochemicals and metabolism have all been found to influence our weight. However, despite our genetic predispositions, it may be possible to overcome these biological factors through willpower. To understand weight loss, it is necessary to know how the body maintains weight. The regulatory systems that keep body weight constant are very efficient. This is the reason why weight loss can be very difficult and only those with exceptional willpower may be successful. The amount of body fat carried is regulated by homeostasis, which ensures that the internal state is kept within a critical range to avoid disruption...","You are a university student.

The acquired language disorder literally translates as the total loss of language function, despite patients not necessarily losing all of their language abilities (Carlson et al, 2004: 388)., and has been found to be the result of damage to the brain and nervous system (Obler, 1999: 1). Libben states that ""the study of aphasia is the most important tool in the investigation of language and the brain"" (1996: 424) with many types of aphasia being identified in recent years spanning all modalities of language. Aphasia is split into two main groups, the fluent and the non-fluent syndromes with fluency being categorised as the ability to express five or more words uninterrupted (Goodglass, 2001: 67). Non-fluent and fluent syndromes demonstrate very different symptoms and are thought to be the result of different injuries.

John Sloan, calls England Wilde's 'mother country', and his society plays are set in the upper class echelons of England, supporting the general public's view that he was a born Englishman. And yet, Wilde spent much of his life in homage to that well-known Anglo-Irish villain, Count Dracula. Like the Count, whose knowledge of English geography surpasses that of his English guest's, Wilde was able to be 'more English than the English themselves' due to his position as an outsider, an Irishman who said himself that he was 'not English', but 'Irish which is quite another thing'. Not only did he classify himself as Irish, but also his work; as Sloan states, 'In artistic matters, Wilde consistently identified himself with a new 'Celtic School' of literature'.

After another fifteen years of campaign, interrupted by the First World War, women were finally granted the vote in 1918 through the Representation of People Act. It remains, however, a controversial matter as to whether the militant campaigns of the WSPU actually helped to quicken the vote for women, or not. In order to get a clearer picture of the tactics of the suffragettes, it is worthwhile to take a closer look at their use of the female body in violent, unconventional and often illegal ways, to draw attention to their cause. The connection of British femininity with a high morality, and the idea of gender equalities through historical argumentation were common ground arguments for the vote in the late nineteenth century. Although arguments of the 'constitutionalists' always sought to stay within the boundaries of middle class respectability, they certainly incorporated argumentation based upon the female body (Holton 1998).

There are a large number of important reasons for this, many of which were interlinked, but the essay will argue that there were four primary explanations, namely, poor relations with the local Native Americans, the choice of Roanoke island itself as the site at which the English decided to settle, the people who actually emigrated to Roanoke including their aims and motives, and finally the lack of support that the colonists received from their mother country, England. With these circumstances in place, the settlement at Roanoke was all but doomed to fail. When the colonists first arrived at Roanoke, their relations with the local Native American tribe (of southern Algonquian stock) were relatively good. They were given food which helped them to survive. Relations were positive on the first visit in July 1584, which was purely a short term expedition to see whether the land was suitable for settlement - 'Indians were friendly and not too numerous."" When they returned to settle permanently in 1585, the colonists were still initially on good terms...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_808,Partnerships in Practice: Responding to Others in Health and Social Care,"There are various social relationships in health and social care. Partnerships are just one of these relationships. It is necessary to be aware that there are different definitions of partnership (Bury, 2004). I will define partnership as a shared understanding and control over a situation; where there are two people involved whose roles are of equal importance. Partnerships between health care professionals enable the sharing of knowledge, ways of working, strengths, skills and resources (Reynolds, 2005). Partnerships benefit patients as treatment becomes based on the most beneficial specialism (Thompson, 1986). Partnerships between colleagues enable communication and practice to be cooperative, respectful and productive. Other partnerships involve the patient or client and their family. In order that the relationship between the health care professional and the client is a partnership it needs to be based on client centred practice (Reynolds, 2005). Traditionally relationships between clients and professionals have been based on high doctor power and control and low patient power and control (Parsons, 1951). This type of relationship depends on distinct and unequal roles of the health care professional and the client (Iphofen and Poland, 1998).

In summary, this Grand Challenge [1] envisages a future where computers are everywhere. Ubiquitous computing is a broad field encompassing other fields such as distributed computing, mobile computing, sensor networks, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence. In this context, the definition of computer is far greater than simply the humble desktop PC. The definition includes the many ""invisible"" (embedded) computers that will/already exist, such as in our vehicles, in our homes, in our buildings, in our communications devices, perhaps even worn on our bodies and many other places besides. In the future these embedded computers will be even more powerful than they are now. Through the use of a multitude of sensors they will become inseparably interweaved with every aspect of our lives, able to detect, analyse and respond to changes/events in their surroundings. These computers will all be networked and interconnected and collectively form ""a single Global Ubiquitous Computer"".

In the 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' or 'DSM-IV', it has been grouped in cluster B of axis II. The manual defines individuals with this disorder as having a tendency to repeatedly break the law without regarding the feelings and rights of people who may become victims of their crimes. DSM-IV includes evidence of impulsiveness in its description, and signs of aggressiveness and lack of empathy. The manual also defines someone with this disorder as being at least eighteen years old and having a history of conduct disorder earlier in life. As a result of their criminal behaviour, many people with antisocial personality disorder end up in prison and there are many questions about how the criminal justice system could better understand these individuals and deal with them in an appropriate way, encouraging them not to re-offend. Some of these questions may be answered by considering the bio-behavioural approach to this disorder.

BAWE,BAWE_598,What considerations frame debates around delinquency among girls?,"The focus of past research on delinquent behaviour has largely been based upon male offending patterns (Smart 1995:16, Petrie 1988:110, Gorman-Smith 2005:15). It can be argued that this research assumed that female offending was insignificant and therefore did not warrant separate investigation (Hudson 1990:116, Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004, 15/16, Kersten 1989:129, Cox 2003:9, Summer 1990:47, Oakley in Heidensohn 1989:85, Richie 2004:231). More recent debates around girl delinquency tend to focus on perceived increasing levels of girl crime (Taylor et at 1997:72, Cox 2003:3, Worrall and Hoy 2004:177, Lessen et al 2000:288) and/or the conflicting evidence regarding lower levels of crime versus boys (Muncie 1999 in Worrall and Hoy 2004:17). For example, The Home Office reports that in 2002 ""four out of five crimes were committed by men and that male offenders outnumbered female offenders by more than four to one"" (National Statistics Office website 2005 :1). Whilst self reporting studies show higher levels of youth crime overall, this could be explained by the fact that many crimes remain unreported and do not, therefore, appear in official statistics (Budd et all 2005:15, Lessen et al 2000:289).

It then goes on to discuss their implications for local democracy. <heading>Different Methods of Local Government Revenue Collection</heading><heading>Taxation</heading>Various types of local taxes have been imposed over time. They include rates, the community charge and council tax. Rates were imposed until 1990, and were the main source of local authority revenue dating back to 1601. They were imposed on occupiers of non-agricultural land, domestic dwellings and industrial and commercial properties. Rateable value was usually taken to be the net annual value, being the amount for which the property could be let. Some advantages of rates were that the tax base was certain and the yield was predictable. Taxpayers were used to this tax - the old saying ""an old tax is no tax"" (Harvey and Jowsey, 2004) holds true. The taxing authority was also the spending authority in the area and was accountable to the local electorate. Taxpayers knew in advance what the tax liability in the forthcoming year would be.

The two characters, Quoyle and Estha, from 4 a) and 4b) respectively, are presented indirectly through narrative description, instead of direct speech, act, or thought representation. Their joint theme seems to be that the narrator, whoever s/he is, tries to, using varying facts, forms of description and conjecture, account for, or understand the character in question. The main aim of this essay will be to discern and analyse the function of the writers' different techniques that contribute to the narrator-character-reader dynamic. One of the first things to notice is that whilst 4 b) is simply prose, 4 b) is a shorter piece of prose, with a picture, a dictionary-style definition of 'Quoyle' and the title 'Quoyle' in bold. Before discussing the latter generic and graphological deviations, we will discuss something that the length of the pieces drew attention to.

It attempts to answer whether the outcome can be explained by use of the median voter theorem and concludes that this is the case in as far as the predictions that result from implementing the theorem are as vague as the variables that it considers. The General Election of 2005 was, in comparison to those of 1979 and 1997, a fairly lacklustre one and in this respect, the median voter theorem fairs well when analysing it. The economic theories devised in Adam Smith's magnum opus The Wealth of Nations gave rise to the political paradigm of rational choice. The concept of self-interested individuals persuing maximum utility, and thus resulting in collective welfare, was one that could be applied to politics as effectively as Smith applied it to economics. Though Smith himself denied the importance of his economic theories in a political light, later developments and technical conceptualizations of his work proved both resultant and influential. <fnote>Smith, A.

BAWE,BAWE_83,Why was Calvinism the most successful brand of Protestantism in later sixteenth Century Europe?,"Calvinism was by far the most successful brand of Protestantism in the second half of the sixteenth century as illustrated by its rapid spread throughout the continent into countries such as France (where the Calvinists were known as 'Huguenots'), Germany, the Netherlands and Scotland as well as vast areas of eastern Europe. 'It was 'an international movement which threatened to disrupt and destabilize the established order of western Europe'. For example, in France in 1562, it is estimated by the historian Alister E.

BAWE,BAWE_671,Is 'race' just another term for ethnicity? Discuss,"'Race' and ethnicity are both terms used commonly within contemporary society, but their definitions and history sets them apart. The term 'race' has a long history steeped in hierarchy and inequality, whilst ethnicity, being a relatively new term, does not have this misfortune. 'Race' thinking, often leads to racism, and its concentration on phenotypical attributes and physical difference causes people to not look at commonalities, but at difference. 'Race' was used to justify slavery and colonialism, and 'race-science' did this by assuming natural differences, leading to eugenics, which caused the working-class 'race' to be controlled. Ethnicity does not have this history but whether the two terms are the same depends on how ethnicity is defined. There is not one single definition for ethnicity; is it a fixed, static, ascribed (primordial) role (like 'race') or is it contextual and constantly in flux? Commonsense thinking, often use the two terms interchangeably, with little differentiation between them (also seen in the confused terminology of the census).

Although the basis of the protest was to do with class and social status, the events of May 1968 had an important impact on women. In fact, a new type of feminism emerged in France following the events in May 1968 and the 1970s heralded the emergence of women writers on a much larger scale than ever before. Les mots pour le dire was published in 1975 and is a striking example of writing that was influenced by this new feminism. Although there had been women writers before, writing on topics not deemed suitable for female authors, such as Simone de Beauvoir, women started to explore themes not discussed before.

However, major institutional reforms, such as the Single European Act (1986) led a number of researchers to question the affect that these institutional changes would have on the structure of Europe and the nature of its political processes; ""Theoretical progress first occurred in the analysis of the ways in which institutional reforms such as the introduction of the SEA have redistributed decision-making power among the competing actors."" (Schneider et al, 2001:7) 'New Institutionalism' is the name for the approach which arose out of these enquiries and has gained such impetus that it has even ""begun to make in-roads in the theoretical landscape once dominated by Intergovernmentalism and Supranationalism"" offering a credible alternative to the dominance of rational approaches. (Schneider et al, 2001:13) For New Institutionalist scholars, it has become increasingly evident that understanding change requires comprehension of how the need for deliberate wide-ranging reform may depend on how routine processes of institutional learning and adaptation are working.

David Crystal (2005:38) states that, 'One of the chief forms of sociolinguistic identity derives from the way in which people are organized into hierarchically ordered social groups, or classes.' The fact that we have different societies and lifestyles is reflected in the way we use language. Firstly one must understand what class is - a social or power variable that can be calculated using: the occupation of the family's breadwinner; the education of the respondent; and the family income. These class boundaries are however not clear-cut and their fluid nature makes ascertaining results from specific social groups somewhat challenging. Peter Trudgill (2000:24) states that social barriers and social distance cause differences in linguistic choices in the same way as geographical distance. The 'social stratification' or hierarchical ordering...",You are a university student. Write an essay on the topic What is the effect of the social variables of class and gender on the way we speak?

BAWE,BAWE_286,Nationalism: a Weakening Ideology or an Enduringly Potent Political Force?,"In his 1813 masterpiece Peter Schlemihl, the German poet Aldebert von Chamisso compared citizens lacking a nation to a man lacking his shadow. Nations and nationalism have indeed long been considered vital to our identities. As the current abundance of separatist movements suggests (the ETA in Spain, the Kurds in Iraq, or the Tamils in Sri Lanka), following its inception with the 1789 French Revolution and its gradual spread outside of Europe through anti-colonial struggles, nationalism remains a dominant political force today. What explains this potency? To quote historian Benedict Anderson, ""what makes people love and die for nations, as well as hate and kill in their name?"" Many attribute the ideology's force to its reliance on the psychological impacts of shared language, ethnicity, religion and history. Others, however, see ""the apparent universal ideological domination of nationalism [as an] optical illusion"", and argue that nationalism is declining in today's globalizing world. Will this ideology remain influential throughout the 21 st Century? By investigating what factors have fostered nationalism in the past, and by assessing to what extent nationalism's flaws are today undermining its bases, one may ascertain whether ""the flesh and blood of populations [will] still [be] swayed by appeals...",You are a university student.

This essay shall examine the period between 1760 and 1830; the 1760s seeing the introduction of important inventions, such as Hargreaves' Spinning Jenny, and Watts' steam engine, and the period until 1830 being one in which these macroinventions were still being improved to provide greater utility. Crafts (2002), for instance, states that until 1830 water power was still often more inexpensive than steam power. A revolution could be thought of as being an almost complete transformation in many aspects of society, with ""industrial"" implying an almost complete revolution from an agrarian to an industrialised economy involving factories and mass production. Important changes socially, technologically and economically could therefore be implied by this definition. This essay shall however argue that whilst important technological change did occur, the fact that the full potential impact had yet to occur showed that this period constituted an important prerequisite for what was to follow rather than constituting the revolution in itself.

BAWE,BAWE_329,South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission failed in its main aims. Discuss.,"An evaluation of the work of the TRC requires us to remember, at the very outset, that reconciliation is a complex, multi-dimensional concept, and any attempts at defining and measuring the term should, therefore, be approached with a certain degree of caution. Towards this end, it is interesting to note Hamber and van der Merwe's identification of at least five different understandings of the concept of reconciliation in South Africa, non-racial, intercommunal, religious, human rights, and community building; these ideologies may comfortably co-exist, but have been at the core of conflict between different groups during the process of the TRC. This theory is useful in our present context as it provides the basis of one of the ways in which the various grounds of criticisms levelled against the TRC may be categorised. The dissatisfaction that a particular individual, group or institution might express towards the work of the TRC, based upon its predominant ideology of reconciliation, does not necessarily translate into dissatisfaction with the performance of the TRC but possibly with one or more of the principles that it bases itself upon, such as its use of the language of Christian forgiveness, to name just one example. <fnote>Borer, Tristan Anne,...",You are a university student.

Current research is increasingly showing that these numbers are severe underestimates, as dementia affects almost all people a patient interacts with (Gilliard, 2001). In fact, the sheer amount of literature on caregiver well-being aptly demonstrates the profound psychological effects on the caregiver as well. The psychological effects on both patients and caregivers appear to be causal and heavily overlap, that is to say, the psychological effects on the patient tend also to have corresponding psychological effects on the caregiver and vice versa. Therefore, I propose that in order to extend our understanding of dementia, we should work towards a more integrated focus, exploring the links between the effects on the patient and the carer. This essay will discuss the psychological effects of dementia on the patient and the caregiver and the impact of these effects on one another, using Alzheimer's disease (AD) as my primary example.

BAWE,BAWE_165,To what extent does the reduction in the number of elected union representatives in the French workplace reflect a decline in union influence?,"Trade union representation in the workplace is currently being debated in France as some union confederations, namely the CGT and CFDT, and employers question the existing framework of representation in the light of whether it weakens trade union legitimacy in the workplace (Hege 2000). This is an important topic because workplace legitimacy may help increase support for the unions and encourage collective bargaining that is more effective. Trade union support tends to be measured by membership levels, which are low in France (Visser 2000). It is difficult, however, to use this measurement as a reflection of union support as incentives to join a trade union are low. Firstly, the presumed representative status of the main union confederations means that workers, members and non-members, will benefit from collective agreements. Secondly, workers perceive that state intervention will bring about improvements in working conditions rather than collective bargaining (Milner 1999). This is just one example of an ambiguous interpretation of union influence which, in this case, leads to an underestimation (Jeffreys 1996b). It is important to look beyond these simplistic measures, therefore, and this essay will consider the appropriateness of using measures of elected union representatives as a reflection of union support or...",You are a university student.

Indeed, at times similar linguistic devices are employed by the poets, yet they are utilised in different ways in order to create rather quite unique effects. Armitage's poem takes the form of a sonnet, which is immediately indicative of love, yet the way in which the poem is written is certainly far from the traditional sonnets of Shakespeare and such like, and lacks the romantic aspect of the traditional verse. Instead, Armitage's poem is rife with colloquial language at its simplicity from the very beginning with 'I am very bothered when I think', not to mention several monosyllabic and polysyllabic words as opposed to the longer more extravagant expressions which one would expect to find in a sonnet.

This essay will outline different dispersal strategies and discuss the various hypotheses that have been put forward to explain why primates disperse. It will focus specifically on three different examples of dispersal types, female-biased dispersal in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), male-biased dispersal in East African vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and both-sex dispersal in red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus), but touch on other examples where relevant. These strategies will then be discussed in an attempt to clarify the genetic consequences of dispersal for the individual, the social group and species population structure. Implications for conservation will also be discussed. Although it was previously assumed that male-biased dispersal was the norm, there is growing evidence to show that many species practice bisexual dispersal and also a few species where females disperse. Species in which the females are philopatric and the males disperse are probably still the most common, certainly with most cercopithecines (Cheney and Seyfarth, 1983). However, many lemurs, some colobines and almost all neotropical primates provide examples of species where both...","You are a university student.

Why is this and what is gained through the use of such techniques?,"<heading>Introduction</heading>Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, terms such as 'total quality management (TQM)', 'communication', 'autonomy', 'empowerment', 'teamworking' spread all over the management literature. All of these terms are closely related to the concept of employee involvement (EI), which is popular in the practice of human resource management. Employee involvement, was defined by Lawler (1986, cited in Fenton-O'Creevy, 2001: 25) as 'a combination of processes which increase the power of employees, enhance the use of appropriate reward and performance measurement systems to align the interests of individuals with organisational goals, improve communication (both vertically and laterally) and increase performance feedback'. Employee involvement is a general term used to cover various forms of managerial strategies in communication, participation and representation (IRRR 96). Forms of EI can be classified as 'direct' and 'indirect'. Direct employee involvement (DEI) means 'employees are in some way directly involved in their immediate place of work', whereas indirect employee involvement (IEI) is where 'some notion of a representative structure is involved' (Eurofound), such as works councils and collective bargaining. In other words, communication and participation belong to DEI, which is the main focus of this essay.

The race for empire, World War I, the Suffrage movement, and conflict in Ireland, as well as popular concerns over novel ways of thinking: nihilism, relativism, fakery- all gave rise to a desire for radical breaks with tradition in favour of new beginnings; a desire that 'penetrated the interior of artistic invention.""

These were the remarks of the late, former Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam when she left office in June 2001. Her assessment reflects increasing debate within British politics regarding the style of Britain's current Prime Minister and the apparent phenomenon of 'creeping presidentialism'. An analysis of the validity of such concerns requires definition of the concepts of 'Prime Ministerial' and 'Cabinet' government whilst this apparent trend must not be considered a product of Blair's premiership alone. Much evidence of a growth in Prime Ministerial power at the expense of Cabinet government can be drawn from the Thatcher era. In addition there remain examples of when Cabinet government has flexed its political muscles and limited the executive strength of the Prime Minister. Some commentators have argued that the recent public Cabinet furore over a ban on smoking and education reforms illustrates the vibrant health of Cabinet government.

For realists, the sovereign state is the dominant actor in the anarchical world system. The theory suggests that individual states organise their actions, face the world as a unitary actor and proceed rationally to pursue state interests of power and security.

It also considers the explosion of the education ethos of today's learning society, and discovers how collective learning can still take place in an environment that encourages a more individualistic approach.

Catullus' view towards marriage and friendship, both of which could be seen as a form of love relationship, also follow this theory. Marriage is a kind of goal for a couple where a proper lover and a beloved should end up, and friendship, while occurring normally between people of the same gender and not involving sexual relationship, in other aspects has similar characteristics to Love. For Catullus, all these three types of relationship seem to be working in the same way: that is, similarly evoking both positive and negative emotions simultaneously.

Each of the three stanzas is of equal length and metre, the first five lines of each stanza working in iambic tetrameter followed by the final line of iambic pentameter, reverting to the traditional metre in Shakespeare's love sonnets. Perhaps this steady lyrical rhythm represents the steady heartbeat of the speaker emphasised by the masculine single rhyme scheme, thus linking to the theme of love presented throughout the poem. Supporting this idea is that as the poem draws to a climax in the third stanza, the natural flow of the final lines are broken up by punctuation more often than elsewhere in the 'song' and an exclamation of 'But which, O Cupid, wilt thou take?' possibly conveying the increasing intensity of feelings of the speaker and confusion in her heart, showing how deeply the situation affects her. <fnote>M.

Adopted since the turn of the century up to today, as a corporate strategy, M&A is continuing to grow in an exponential fashion. The bulk of M&A occurred in the fourth and fifth wave, in the 1980`s and the 1990`s respectively.

It is inherent in his conception of the nature of man and from there a driving force towards the development of a political society. The political society that Hobbes aims to create, as the logical conclusion of his premises about man, is an absolute sovereignty with no restrictions on the ruler, an idea that Locke vehemently attacks in the Two Treatises. This absurdity Locke illustrates using his polecats and lions, an attack not necessarily specifically directed at Hobbes, but like much of the Treatises was an attempt to detect and overthrow 'the false principles and foundations of Sir Robert Filmer', who repeatedly contended that 'A King according to law makes no kind of government'. Hobbes, however, is the most famous exponent of the defence of the absolute monarchical tradition, most famously in Leviathan but also in De Cive and De Corpore Politico and for this reason consideration of his hypothetical response to the criticism is of the utmost importance.

BAWE,BAWE_21,Vehicle of Propaganda or Agent of Subversion? Cold War Hollywood Bomb Cinema 1950-1963.,"For too long the history of the Cold War has been written from a 'top-down' perspective examining elites and decision-makers. Whilst political scientists have become mired in using rational International Relations models, historians have rarely cast their net beyond realpolitik, frequently falling foul of detailed narrative around contingencies which often never occurred. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the 30-year rule for many documents in the West, which both led to a spate of archival-based sources available to historians, cemented this diplomatic and empirical approach. Moreover, archival work alone is a dangerous place from which to survey the Cold War, since both sides of the Iron Curtain employed 'newspeak' rather than rational discourse, even behind closed doors. In short, this 'New Cold War history' can become overly narrative driven and blind to broader analysis. However, as a result of the growing interest in cultural history following the 1980s 'linguistic turn', recent study, particularly in the so called 'Constructivist' school, has challenged Cold War historians to spread their wings methodologically, and explore the culture of the conflict. In spite of noteworthy 'hot' episodes, such as Vietnam, the Cold War was in most part a conflict...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_876,The Author to her book' by Anne Bradshaw. A close reading,"A simplified initial view of Anne Bradshaw's poem 'The Author to Her Book' is that she has a negative view on her poetry. Within the first few lines of verse, she uses negative words and phrases; ""ill-formed"", ""feeble""(1), ""snatched""(3) and ""exposed""(4), all of which primarily produce pessimistic connotations. They could also be considered litotes; the word ""feeble"" especially. Bradshaw goes on to describe how editing her writing is a difficult process, ""I cast thee by as one unfit for light"". This statement could be considered a continuation of the negative language felt earlier. To me however, she shows herself to be a highly competent poet, who is prepared to scrutinise her own work in order to achieve the best possible result. Indeed one could argue that from the moment the poem begins, she personifies her written work, likening it to the birth of a child, ""Thou ill formed off-spring from my brain"". Offspring is usually a word to describe something that is positive and special, something to be celebrated. One could infer therefore that Bradshaw draws attention to the weaknesses of her work in order to highlight its main strengths.

BAWE,BAWE_962,Is it accurate to discuss the citizen women of Athens in terms of 'seclusion'?,"The term 'seclusion' refers to the condition of being cut off from others, or being excluded from a particular place. The position of the citizen women of fifth century Athens has often been described using the term, 'seclusion'. Due to limited sources it is hard for today's historians to know very much about the life of the Athenian woman, and furthermore all evidence for the subject comes from works made by male writers and artists, (Blundell in Sparkes ed. 1998: 232) resulting in a very limited insight into how Athenian women lived and the modern day reader needs to remember that since we are only ever subjected to the males view of women rather than the reality of women's lives, we cannot be sure of the accurateness of some sources. In this sense it can be said that the women of fifth century Athens lived lives of seclusion, since we have no evidence of the Athenian woman's opinion. However it is also debated that the women of Athens had a reasonable level of freedom by comparison to other women of the time in other tribes and states.

Introduction</heading>The legal status of trade unions in the United Kingdom was established by a Royal Commission in 1867, which agreed that the establishment of the unions was to the benefit both employers and employees. Since then, unions have been upheld as the traditional promoters of justice and fairness at the workplace. Trade union membership experienced a meteoric rise from late 1968 to 1979(Blyton and Turnbull, 2004, p.139) However from 1979 till date unionism has been declining progressively. The steady and continuous disintegration of collective organization in British workplaces since 1979 in terms of union membership, union density and collective bargaining coverage has been remarkable. Union membership shattered from its peak at 12.6 million in 1979 to 7.1 million in 1998, a significant reduction in membership density of the employed workforce from 56% to 30%.( Terry, 2003,p.459). Similarly, collective bargaining coverage fell drastically from around 80% of the workforce to a mere over a third in 1998. (Heery, Kelly and Waddington, 2000, p.79) Decline has been the steepest in the private sector where membership losses ran from more than half in 1980 to as low as 19% in late 1999.The public sector recorded a fall from 84% in 1980 to...",You are a university student.

Others may come from tropical rainforest areas so need humid warm environments to live in. As these animals are ectothermic, their thermoregulation is done through their behaviour. In order to do this they not only need warm terrariums, but also need a thermal gradient throughout so that they may cool down or warm up as they need. Reptiles also have varied and often specific diets, and finding their natural foods in captivity may prove difficult. These complex needs must be met in captivity or health problems will arise. It is said that 90% of problems in captive reptiles are caused by incorrect care (S. Nash, 2004), this may be largely due to owners assuming that all reptiles need the same living conditions.

Since it is established that performance in the workplace depends on how much and on the reason why an individual is willing to act (Gellerman 1965: 7), the question remains on what best explains human incentive. The purpose of this paper is to assess which motivation theory best explains people's willingness to work hard. The paper reflects on human motivation with relevance to different views on human nature, and examines a selection of individual needs and motivation theories. There are two main types of motivational theories, namely content and process theories. The main difference is the assumption on individual needs at work. Content theories assume that all people have the same set of needs, and that these needs motivate behavior (Fincham & Rhodes 2005: 193). In contrast, process theories assume that all humans have different needs, and focus on how cognitive processes, or ""the way we take in and process information about ourselves and the world,"" (Fincham & Rhodes 2005: 193) influences these needs. Process theories are more concerned with explaining the effect of individual differences on the level of motivation, so that motivation is a result of...",You are a university student.

Moreover use of language is different depending on certain groups of identity in particular gender differences between male and female enable to vary styles of language or lexical expressions widely. Furthermore these distinctions seem to emphasise a sense of identity such as masculinity or femininity as behaviours or attitudes. This essay will firstly discuss how men's language and women's language are dissimilar from three points. These points are vocabulary, speech styles and ways of interaction. In addition this essay will move to analyse how these differences are made while taking consideration of social life in early childhood and social relations in genders and then conclude on how much linguistic identity is important in establishing a sense of identity between genders in social context.

His thesis rests on the idea that not only is life in a modern metropolis more impersonal and individualistic than in pre-modern society, but that it is this very impersonality that allows individuality to flourish. While most authors today would agree on a definition of the modern metropolis as a major city, large and densely populated perhaps including several independent administrative districts, and often regarded as the centre of a specific activity, a brief description of the distinction between pre-modern society and a modern metropolis is perhaps needed to understand the different premises Simmel starts from in his study. He believes the 'ancient polis' to have had the character of a small town. 'The incessant threat against enemies...brought about that stern cohesion on political and military matters, that supervision of the citizen by other citizens, and that jealousy of the whole toward the individually whose own private life was repressed to such an extent that he could compensate himself only by acting as a despot in his own household'(Simmel, 1971).

Stimulated by the works of Erasmus and Christian Humanism, the Reformation ""sought reform of the universal Catholic Church"", and essentially transformed Christianity.

One of the most notable is King Henry VIII who abused the fractious state of Christianity during the Reformation, manipulating scripture in order to enhance his power.

There is an understanding between patients and doctors, and the patients have a lot more power over their treatment than ever before, especially due to the vast amount of medical information that can be obtained by the Internet. Although this may be the case, doctors are still viewed by society as a figure of authority and as an individual with a high degree of influence over the patients health. Increasingly patients now expect doctors to have the opportunity to change not only their health but they expect to be increasingly involved in their own care. With an increasing ethnic minority population, doctors are entrusted to look after their health.

Stemming largely from the desire to avoid the harsh glare of the ethnocentric critical light, traditional categories including colonialism, politics, society and even styles of ethnographic writing have undergone deconstructions that were much needed if not openly welcomed. The categorical manifestation of the dualist paradigm is represented in the form of the nature-culture and nature-society dichotomies which, as it is now universally agreed, represent little more than stumbling blocks in our attempts to understand the particular intricacies of human societies.

BAWE,BAWE_429,Private/independent and state schools are completely different (and separate) entities. Critically discuss.,"The existence of an independent sector of schooling as a fee-paying alternative to state provision has drawn considerable attention, ever since the 1944 Education Act first established free education as a right. The sector as a whole is small: the Independent Schools Council (ISC) (n.d.) estimate that there are approximately 2,500 independent schools in the UK, catering for just seven per cent of the school-age population. It would thus be fair to ask why this educational minority attracts 'a level of public debate which is out of all proportion to their numerical significance' (Fox, 1984, p.45). One finds a likely solution in the extent to which these forms of schooling have been identified as offering a fundamentally different type of education. Chubb and Moe (1997, p.364) tell us that 'the organisation of schools is largely endogenous to the system of institutional control in which the schools are embedded.' This suggests that the different governing mechanisms experienced by the state and independent sectors must produce fundamentally distinct types of school.

Does the anthropocentric dimension of our Western civilization allow us to think of natural-nonhumans as rights holders? Can the consumptive and exploitative structure of the Western model of life, which considers development as against nature, shift to a preservationist one? The emergence of the concepts of sustainable development in international law can be seen as a first step towards this end. But these notions are still focused on the well-being of the human species: sustainable development, the conservation of natural resources and wilderness for its needs are the concern of the current environmental policies. The preservation of the environment per se is not taken into account. We need an environmental ethic based on a rational theory which thinks the ways to live in harmony with our environment. Is the language of rights the appropriate one or should we shift to another one, an environmental rationale?

BAWE,BAWE_30,Do Twentieth Century Massacres Share Common Characteristics?,"Steven Katz claims in his essay on the historical perspective of the Holocaust that 'the intentional murder of European Jewry during World War II, is historically and phenomenologically unique', and it is possible to forget that despite the notoriety of the Jewish Question there have been other massacres during the twentieth century. Annihilations have occurred in many countries throughout the century including Turkey, Rwanda, China, Bosnia and Cambodia, and whilst there are significant differences between each one- such as method of slaughter, death toll and time span of persecution- there are some factors common to them all. In fact, the Holocaust was not even the first great massacre of the twentieth century as the Armenian genocide occurred during the First World War, and Melson argues that it is 'a more accurate archetype than is the Holocaust for current mass murder in the postcolonial third world and in the contemporary post-communist world'. However this does not exclude the Holocaust from sharing common characteristics with other massacres (as Katz disputes) for, on a fundamental level, patterns can be drawn between them.

BAWE,BAWE_111,To what extent can the changing priorities and organisation of the English East India Company between 1757 and 1857 be explained by interactions with Indian elites?,"The English East India Company had been established in 1600 as trading Joint Stock Company. Initially it was content with setting up bases in the West Coast of India for exporting valuable commodities such as spices, calicoes, precious metals and jewels to Europe. Therefore, it sustained a current account deficit in the opening century or its trade with Mughal India. However, by the time the British Crown under Queen Victoria formally replaced it as the official administrators of matters pertaining to India in 1858, it had turned its deficit into a massive surplus. Whereas initially gold and silver bullion flowed into India to account for the expensive luxury commodities being purchased from her, by the turn of the 19 th century India was importing en masse from the product portfolio of the company. Such changes in the fortunes of the East India Company must be attributed primarily to the successful political conquest of the lucrative trading regions of the Indian sub-continent, as the company was able to remove competition and establish a hegemonic presence in these markets. That the company found itself in such a position meant that its priorities, organisations and policy formulation had been undergoing changes through out....",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_331,Which early infant abilities and preferences might facilitate later language development?,"Language development seems like a very difficult task, and yet nearly all babies are very successful at it. This has prompted Chomsky to famously suggest that babies have an innate 'language acquisition device' (Harley, 2001), but now it seems rather that babies are born with a number of various 'devices', or predispositions and abilities, through which they learn language. Despite the tendency to see babies as passive learners, just absorbing language, babies are actually very active in the process, interacting with the people around them in a way that will help their language development. There are several mechanisms that they have to help them along this path, such as getting attention from adults, innate preferences for useful stimuli, in-built perception skills to help them decode speech, and forming an attachment which helps construct a very beneficial environment for improving language abilities. The first and most important characteristic of babies for their later language development is the indisputable fact that they are very social, that is they are predisposed to seek interaction with other human beings, right from birth. Babies depend entirely on care provision from others, and even when their basic needs of food, warmth and physical comfort are met,...",You are a university student.

However, the recent legal developments have been to the detriment of the floating charge holders. Although the Enterprise Act (EA) 2002, the Companies Act (CA) 2006 and the House of Lords decision in National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus and others have clarified the law, the floating charges have become less lucrative to lenders. As a result of the reforms, the floating charge holders are afforded less protection and have a lower priority in insolvency situations. This is particularly problematic for small companies, because they rely heavily on the floating charge as a security for their debt. Due to the recent changes, banks and other lenders are likely to become more reluctant to give loans to companies with little or no fixed assets. Therefore, it has been argued that the reforms have undermined the benefits of the floating charge. Nevertheless, the floating charge is a beneficial security in many circumstances and therefore, it remains significant from a legal perspective. <fnote>[2005] UKHL 41 </fnote><heading>DEVELOPMENT OF THE FLOATING CHARGE</heading>In order to understand the uses and limitations...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_105,Authority and servility of women in Early Modern marriages,"The law granted great power to men in marriages, suggesting women were completely subservient to their husband in early modern England; the ownership of her property transferred into his control- 'the husband hath therein an immediate and absolute property devolved to him by the marriage...which can never again revert to the wife'- and he could dispose of her income 'as he thought best'. Seemingly, the foundations of her life were in the power of her partner, forcing her to be utterly compliant to his wishes: 'Mine husband is my superior, my better; he hath authority and rule over me'. Arguably, spousal relations mirrored a slave-master relationship where women were totally dependent on their husbands to subsist. Indeed, this model of husband-wife relations is elaborated by the fact that, officially, women were the property of their husbands, as she had no separate legal identity. By analysing sources such as letters and diaries however, we gain greater insight into how women did have authority over her husband outside the law, especially emotionally. These sources have limitations- a diary can be written at times of intense emotion, often unreflective of normality- and the essay will address these. Nonetheless, if various sources are studied,...",You are a university student. Write an essay on the topic Authority and servility of women in Early Modern marriages.,,,

First of all I will start by briefly talking about what the lexicon is. The essay will continue to the summary on how the lexicon is structured in recent perspectives. It will be explained with three approaches, lexicalization, sense relations and lexical composition. As dimensions of lexical composition, qualia and semantic primes otherwise known as primitives are described. It will also evaluate these approaches while explaining the contribution to the lexical field by theoretical and descriptive linguists. Finally there will be a conclusion about the new trends in the lexical field. To begin with according to Crystal (2003) lexicon for linguistics means all the meaningful elements in a language. It includes morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes as well as the words and idioms. Singleton (1999) gives more detailed explanation on the meaningful units. He argues that these meaning units for example show colligation, collocation and lexical semantics. Colligation simply refers to grammatical necessity. The basic example of this is a restricted range of relations such as between a verb and the following complements (Singleton, 1999). For instance prevent from Xing, interfere with X.

Exchange and specialised production, or craft specialisation as commonly known, have to some extent been emphasised as significant attributes thus projecting the Neolithic into its rightful importance. This has been particularly so since exchange and craft specialisation have implications for the organisation of time and labour and consequently these have been associated with the beginnings of social differentiation. As Renfrew has pointed out (1973: 179, 187), the Neolithic should not be equated only with simple farming communities since there was long-distance trade and craft specialisation in obsidian, Spondylus and textiles. Furthermore, Theocharis (1973: 60), in a social evolutionary mindset, has interpreted the increased standardisation of tools and the large amounts of Melian obsidian in Middle Neolithic Thessaly as indicators of ""stabilisation and improvement"". When using primary material regarding the Aegean Neolithic, a number of limitations emerge in the definition of evidence per se. A certain amount of information from early excavations has been lost.

The lack of a single voice is a trait common to all theories of International Relations. Despite this, there are 'major conceptual ideas' which allow Liberalism to distinguish itself as a separate theory of International Relations. The two major conceptual ideas which form the normative basis and ultimate goal of all strands of Liberalism, (the identification of which can be supported by John Gray, Kant and Keohane - see footnotes), can be summarised as follows: 1. The melioric principle that human beings and the life of humans can be subject to improvability. 2. The emphasis on individual rights and freedoms as a means by which improvability can progress. However, as with all theories of International Relations, normative goals require a method of implementation.

It also presents us with a new type of hero, a Roman hero, in contrast to the Greek heroes of Homer's epic poems ""The Iliad"" and ""The Odyssey"". Aeneas' heroism can be defined as ""Roman"" due to a number of characteristics that we see through his actions in the poem, the most obvious of these being the quality of pietas that Virgil frequently associates him with in his epithets, for example: ""Devout Aeneas"" and ""Dutiful Aeneas"".

The character of the state, the way it operates in the world system and its role as a tool of governance has changed as a result of the globalization process within the last several decades that has witnessed the ""dramatic intensification"" of transnational interactions (Santos 2002: 165).

On the one hand, Locke has several conditions attached to how much land and perishable goods any human can accumulate, stemming from his Christian belief that, ""The earth and all that is therein is given to men for the support and comfort of their being"". Locke believed that the earth, given to mankind in common by God, must be able to support the entire human species. This, according to Locke, could not be possible if men were allowed to accumulate possessions limitlessly, as this could leave others without the ability to preserve their lives. However, it is important to see that Locke attaches these conditions to meet the end of preserving mankind; they do not necessarily have to be followed if there is an alternative, which does not break the fundamental laws of nature. The advent of money brought about this alternative, one in which man did not have to work his land to provide his sustenance, nor would he even have to own land to be able to access food; he could simply buy it.

BAWE,BAWE_658,Is self-love the only motivation for action that Adam Smith recognizes?,"In order to explain and predict economic reality, many have sought an understanding of the basic unit of analysis, the individual, and what it is that motivates human behaviour. In economic theory, human actions have often been reduced to one motive, expressed by Edgeworth in 1881: ""the first principle of Economics is that every agent is actuated only by self-interest."" A rational, self-interested individual is assumed to have the objective of maximizing the expected value of her own payoff. She is assumed to have a consistent preference ordering, often assumed to be in terms of material consumption. The value of the payoff is measured on a utility scale. Some Chicago school economists such as George Stigler understand the founding father of economics, Adam Smith, to have constructed his economic theory on the 'granite' foundations of self-interest being the sole motive for human action. Therefore, Smith is seen as the prime forerunner of neo-classicism. But was self-interest really the only motivation for human action that Smith recognized?

The combination of two analytical techniques provides far more information than using each separately. LCMS can provide a chromatographic trace of a sample, on par with HPLC, along with the mass spectra of each fraction of the sample. This can provide essential structural information on compounds in the sample without having to isolate them and analyse them separately. One of the most important aspects of LCMS is the interface between the liquid chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. Mass analysis requires the analyte to be in the form of gaseous ions within a vacuum. However, liquid chromatography requires the analyte to be neutral and in solution at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, there are three main aspects important to each type of LCMS interface: evaporation, pressure reduction and ionisation. The evaporation of the eluent from the LC is required to convert the analyte from the liquid to the gas phase. The pressure reduction is required to create the low pressures or vacuum needed. Ionisation converts the neutral analyte molecules to ions. Different interfaces deal with these three issues in different ways and in different orders, with each with its own advantages and...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_715,Discuss the proposition that the concept of gender is central to the project of globalisation,"In the past two decades there has been much discussion about the nature of globalisation -the project of which has had a profound impact on both men and women alike. The strategies which have shaped this process have long been regarded as being capitalist, gender and class bias. This paper is primarily concerned with the interrelationship between gender and globalisation. It will be argued that gender relations provide the base on which the global economy has flourished. Here, emphasis will be placed on the notion that gender has not only been shaped by, but also shapes our global world. Rather than accepting unequal gender relations as an outcome of globalisation, we will show how it is these very relations which characterize its project. In this way, the paper adopts Connell's (1987 cited in Bayes et al, 2001: 1) concept in which he sees gender as an 'active agent which creates divisions of labour, power and emotions between men and women'. Thus after briefly tracing how concepts of gender and globalisation have been reviewed, the focus of this paper will then to concentrate on examining four main issues. Firstly, in what ways has flexiblisation of the labour force shaped the project...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_799,Exploring the role of violence in selected contemporary Latin American cinema,"Scenes of violence are relatively common in film, and contemporary Latin American cinema is no exception. However, the type and grade of violence, and the context in which it is portrayed, differ significantly from one film to the next. It is therefore useful - and arguably necessary - to examine each expression of violence on its own merits and in the context of the film in order to really understand what purpose it serves. Several questions stand out as central to this analysis: What manifestations of violence are shown? How is it used by directors/writers? What effect does the violence have on the viewer? How does it contribute to our understanding of the film's story and characters? How, if at all, does the portrayal of violence in contemporary cinema reflect the realities of modern Latin American society? What societal values/views do the films expose regarding violence? These are the questions which this essay will deal with, using as case studies three critically acclaimed films from recent years: <list>Abril Despedaçado [Behind the Sun] (Brazil, 2001), Walter Salles; Amores Perros [Love's a Bitch] (Mexico, 2000), Alejandro González Iñárritu;Cidade de Deus [City of God] (Brazil, 2002), Fernando Meirelles.</list>While the three films all contain...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_63,Imagine you are designing a curriculum for primary school science classes. Consider how research in cognitive development could help you decide which concepts are taught when.,"The structure of education has been shaped by many cognitive psychologists over the past century, including John Dewey, Arnold Gesell and Lev Vygotsky (Stone, 1996). However, it is Jean Piaget who has significantly influenced the structure of education, as mainstream educators have found his theory on child development more substantive and convincing (Stone, 1996; Kohlberg and Mayer, 1972; DeVries, 2000). Piaget's developmental theory is still widely applied to methods of teaching (DeVries, 2000). The premise of his developmental theory that is of interest here is that children's ability to assimilate experiences and consolidate knowledge is directly correlated to their age. The four stages of development, the sensori-motor stage, pre-operational stage, concrete operational stage and the formal operational stage are said to all occur within specified age brackets. It is also a domain general theory. Domain generality proposes that knowledge, once gained, can be applied across many different contexts and situations (Slater, Hocking and Loose, 2003). Recently however, Piagetian schooling techniques have been challenged by the emergence of much new cognitive developmental research. Research done by, amongst others McCloskey (1985), Massey and Gelman (1988) and Rosengren, Kalish, Gelman and McCormick (1991) has suggested that the cognitive development of specific concepts in...",You are a university student.

They also reduce uncertainty in that they force managers to look ahead, to anticipate change and develop contingency plans in addition to considering risks.

While surveys are used to collect information on individuals, groups and organisations [for example, schools], most often is it is individuals who provide information about themselves. As a research design each survey should contain a statement of it purpose. The goals of survey research may be simply descriptive or may be explanatory.

I will suggest that language and society are so intertwined that it is impossible to understand one without the other and that this intricate link makes it possible for all varieties of English to be intrinsically equal while being perceived as different. I will discuss linguistic variety and regional and social variations as they affect language use by applying knowledge of the linguistic and social factors involved. The term variety refers to language use in context. All varieties of any language have a set pattern of use related to complex, rule-based, structures known to, and used within a specific speech community. (Trudgill, 2000). A speech community is a group of people who share a variety providing a means of communication and a means of identity. (Trask, 1999).

At the same time, however, it is also an exciting material to study which enables us to thoroughly enjoy Aeschylus' use of imagery, the most notable features of his language. In the first place, since the Oresteia was produced at the very end of Aeschylus' career, we can see these three plays as almost perfecting his long interest and experiments in the effective use of imagery. Secondly, since 'plays are written to be performed and experienced in linear fashion by the audience' rather than to be read and analysed repeatedly and closely as many scholars of present time usually do, the form of trilogy, or continuous stories related to each other, is a great place for authors to effectively deploy imageries in order to give the audience a certain emotion and interpretation by using them repeatedly or placing them in a way which imprints a certain association between two objects in the mind of spectators. <fnote>Baldock, p.20 </fnote>In this essay, as such, we shall particularly...",You are a university student.

The question of it existence, therefore, should be answered by examining whether this concept helps us grasp certain aspects of the empirical world otherwise indiscernible. In the past decade, there emerged many radical elaborations of this concept, such as the notion of an emerging 'borderless' world where 'national' is no longer relevant (Reich 1991, Ohmae 1995a), as well as much criticism, such as the claim that global economy 'is much a myth' (Hirst and Thompson 1999). Contrasting the views from both sides, I found those skeptical voices valuable in pointing out some empirical errors of the radical elaborations prevailing previously, but faulted in confusing the radical elaborations with the concept of 'global economy' itself. Instead, I will argue that the concept 'global economy,' though often over-stated, still has its merits in helping us understand today's world.

Not only was the global economy in tatters, but international relations were incredibly strained. The Bretton Woods system of international institutions; the IMF, World Bank and GATT, contextualised against a fixed exchange rate sought to rebuild the international political economy.

Members were committed to maintain par values within a 1% margin of the fixed rate, aided by the IMF, initially set up to bridge any temporary payments imbalances.(Grabbe, O. 1996) Despite the intentions and aims of the Bretton Woods system to create a stable global economic environment, the system collapsed within a quarter of a century of its inception.

For several millennia Native Americans prospered on the continent of North America without interference.

BAWE,BAWE_736,We should treat all trivial things in life very seriously and all the serious things of life with sincere and studied triviality With reference to at least two Wilde texts discuss the way in which he uses this idea in his writing,"Oscar Wilde described this absurd quote as a philosophy, and to some extent it is a philosophy by which much of his literature exists. He raises this simple ploy to an almost ludicrous level in the construction of his social comedies. In so doing he parodies high society, portraying it as obsessed with trivia, to such an extent that it can no longer recognise the serious things in life. Wilde uses the idea to discuss not only major issues such as love and religion but also the topical ones of his time. In some ways the theme of trivialising the serious and vice versa can be attributed to the decadence of the period, which so fascinated Wilde. His works encapsulate many features of the movement, such as perversity, which was considered to be an element of the fin-de-siecle. This is apparent in numerous paradoxical statements and the manner in which characters are so fickle, constantly changing their minds over issues as serious as marriage.

The first requires regularities in the physical world; the second requires associations in the mind. Hume talks as if we can accept either or both but it appears that we need to accept both to fully grasp the intricacies involved in describing cause and effect. The first, physical definition, says that something is a cause if it is contiguous and precedent to some other object and where 'all the objects resembling the former are placed in like relations of precedence and contiguity to those objects that resemble the latter' (Section 14, Treatise of Human Nature). It is not apparent what Hume means by objects resembling each other. Do they have to be identical to each other? Or is there some scope for variety? If there is some scope for variety and difference then it is difficult to see where Hume would draw the line, and say that an event no longer resembles the one being analysed, but resembles some other event instead.

One is autonomous, one may believe, if one's actions are determined by one's self rather than causes external to one's self. One may also wish to claim one is free on the same grounds. Clearly, one's conception of autonomy must rely upon one's conception of the self as well as on one's understanding of causality.

Discuss.,"Emerging as prosperous after the adversity of the Depression and Second World War, 1950s America heralded sustained economic growth and a revitalised faith in capitalism. These developments were bolstered by a pervasive lauding of consumption, in marked contrast to the frugality and emphasis on production of the immediate past. Within a burgeoning consumerist culture, women were the focus of an advertising industry promoting a multitude of modern conveniences. Whilst female consumer prominence was potentially empowering, the mass media overwhelmingly advocated women's retreat to a private, domesticated sphere. Coinciding with the post-war rise in suburban housing and population growth, women came to suffer great pressure to aspire to a housewife ideal. Bolstered by the development of the highway system and availability of automobiles, the suburban exodus reaffirmed conventional gender roles upon a generation of young people. This racial paradigm left no room for those deviating from its stringent criteria, ostracising at once migrating African-American families excluded by segregation.

The Athenians and Spartans had agreed upon a thirty year peace in 446/445BC, which divided the Greek world in half. However, this peace only lasted fifteen years. When the war began, the Spartans and Athenians adopted different strategies.

BAWE,BAWE_301,What part did the factors outlined in Weber's Protestant Ethic play in explaining the divergent economic development of Western and Eastern civilisations,"Max Weber's Protestant Ethic has been one of the most significant and well publicised disputes of twentieth-century scholarship. The associated literature largely portrays, incorrectly, a monocasual relationship between the development of a Protestant ethic and the emergence of modern capitalism, neglecting the more pluralistic explanation, which Weber himself puts forward. Within the Protestant Ethic, Weber identifies the separation of the business from the household, book- keeping, science, law, education, citizenship, climate, and biology as factors that influenced, and were influenced by, the spirit of capitalism and consequently modern capitalist culture. For Weber, the formation of the Protestant religion in the sixteenth century preceded the emergence of this spirit. Thus, Weber argues, the emergence of modern capitalism was facilitated by the formation of the Protestant religion, for it encouraged attributes that were conducive to its progress. These developments of religion, which were lacking in the East, help then to explain the economic divergence between Western and Eastern civilisations. Implicitly, given the pessimistic tone in which Weber concludes, the Protestant Ethic also unveils the dangers of capitalist development. Labour, rather than a religious calling, can develop simply into an economic function as a means in itself. As a result, it is not...",You are a university student.

Time is, in essence, a structural device that can be used to achieve a deliberate affect on a reader or audience.

The term machine de guerre, however, is open to interpretation; this paper will examine how the Déclaration responded to the problems of the Ancien Régime, will examine whether the Déclaration included or provoked any kind of violent conflict towards the Ancien Régime thus warranting the usage of the word guerre and will study whether or not it was 'avant tout' produced for these purposes. 'Ancien Régime' is a term which was created by thinkers and authors of the Enlightenment period to combat and belittle the then existing social and political order which 'was characterised... by aristocratic privilege, on that of the state by monarchical absolutism of divine right."" During the 1780s, in particular, the population of France began to question the increasingly apparent injustice present in society - largely due to a number of wars which bankrupted the country, resulting in widespread poverty coupled with the fact that 'the progress of the Enlightenment had undermined the ideological foundations of this established order.""...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_1115,What inferences can archaeologists make from material remains of the dead?,"Throughout the span of human history many societies and civilisations have risen and fallen, many of these societies have approached the disposal of the dead with a great reverence and ritual. Generally the funeral rites and practices would take days, weeks, months and in some cases years to plan and put into action. They were and still are seen as an important part of separating world of the living from the world of the dead. The material remains of these practices provide archaeologists with invaluable data and evidence to interpret and analyse. This provides the archaeological community with a unique and exciting challenge, every site, tomb and burial must be approached differently depending on the environmental and physical conditions. Artefacts and skeletal remains must be treated with due care and consideration and catalogued in a precise and meticulous manner in order to aid scientific method. If handled properly archaeologists find skeletal remains and their associated artefacts extremely useful for academic study.

BAWE,BAWE_575,How would you describe the relationship between science and society in a democracy: compatible or oppositional?,"The relationship between science and society in a democracy is ambiguous and can be seen as both compatible and oppositional. This relationship can be understood through assessing whether a democratic environment allows for science to be independent of society and progress without be disturbed and through whether the characteristics and principles of democracy parallel or oppose the discipline. Democracy's compatibility is illustrated through the value placed on science by a democracy and the trust given to the subject because of its strong ethos and ability to self regulate which in turn allows it to operate freely and independently of society. Science can be seen to uphold the functions of a democratic society, such as supporting environmental protests, supporting the authority and legitimacy of governments and providing epistemic benefits. However, a democracy allows for the open criticism of science and thus often challenges the integrity of the discipline. Science arguably needs to work in an oppositional manner and maintain elitism to allow the subject to progress. Democracy can be seen as oppositional because society places an emphasis on the importance of science, but this dependence can lead to science being dictated to by a political agenda and threaten the objectivity and...",You are a university student.

Considering its sudden appearance after many centuries of only sporadic archaeological interest of the Near Eastern rulers, the development we are witnessing is very amusing and understandable bearing in mind the recent technological progress. Different areas of the subject were developing constantly and the direction of this development depended on the technologies as much as ideologies. The study of countryside developed already in the 19 th century, when the scholars or rather antiquarians such as Dr. J. Wilson working at Woodperry in 1840s, Mr. S. Stone or Mr. Leeds carried their first excavations on deserted medieval villages. The development of medieval archaeology was inevitably limited by certain factors. It concentrated mainly on churches, castles or manor houses, so their view of medieval life was biased by towards the higher class of the society. Also the works were often carried out by architects, interested in the structure of a feature at one level, instead of digging down to find out more about the chronological sequences (Beresford and Hurst 1971).

Eine Stadt sucht einen M├Ârder, and Der aufhaltsame Aufstieg des Arturo Ui.","Bertolt Brecht's Der aufhaltsame Aufstieg des Arturo Ui is a savage, witty parable written to allegorise the nazi era. His portrayal of crime and justice in the play can be contrasted with those of Fritz Lang's film M. Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder, which is a shocking criminal tale based on various actualities of the time. Lang acknowledged the influence of Brecht as an author and director when he himself directed M in 1931. In reality, such was Brecht's influence that it would have been virtually impossible not to have been during this epoch of German film and literature. However, Arturo Ui was not written until 1941 and was to have a vastly different objective than that of Lang's film. Whilst M is a serious production describing the hysteria caused by an unknown child serial killer in Berlin, Arturo Ui is a satirical play detailing Nazi Germany. Yet despite these competing authorial intentions, parallels can be drawn between the treatment of the paramount theme of crime and justice. The protagonists of the two works occupy different criminal spheres, both in terms of the nature of the illegalities and of the victims claimed.

Lay people's beliefs about health are different from that of the medical profession because they do not have formal medical qualifications or training. During recent years the term lay beliefs has shifted to lay knowledge, belief implies that is not based on sound fact or evidence and may be wrong whereas knowledge is more factual and systematic.

Comment on studies that have tested the validity of these models.,"<heading>Introduction :</heading>The question of what determines long run economic growth has divided Macroeconomists over the last twenty years. According to Solows' neoclassical view, growth can only occur with the change of exogenous factors. Endogenous growth theorists suggest however that economic growth stems from a change from within the structures of the economy. At the base both models share a set of common assumptions. Both production functions are of the form Y=F(A,K,L), i.e. Output is determined by the amount of (K)physical Capital (e.g. machinery or software), (L)Labour (effective labour force) and some parameter A (Total Factor Productivity), which comprises all exogenous factors influencing production, such as technological capabilities, market sector compositions or political systems. An augmented production function would include Human capital (H) as well.

Extension was usually associated with increasing food production and encouraging economic development, having the function of promoting knowledge and transferring technology between farmers and researchers (or farmers to farmers) (Leeuwis, 2004:17). As a way of rethinking the roles of extension services, Van den Ban and Hawkins (1988:9) raised several questions regarding the meaning of extension and its intervention in farmers' decision-making and problem-solving capabilities.

Leaving the conventional top-down, transfer-of-technology schemes, NGOs, public sector and international institutions have more and more progressed towards participatory research and extension approaches. Proponents of this change have argued that traditional, public-funded, on-station research does not address the needs and problems of poor farmers in ""complex, diverse and risk-prone"" areas, because their physical and socioeconomic conditions are too different from those at the research stations. This marginal agriculture takes place in rain-fed, diverse and fragile environments and is characterised by its small scale, complexity and lack of access to markets and resources, in profound contrast to the monocropping, high-input, large-scale farming systems promoted by conventional research (Chambers et al, 1989: p. xviii). It has been asserted that the high levels of diversity among these poor farmers make it unlikely that a specific innovation can be appropriate for a large number of users (Sumberg et al, 2003).

British writers and poets of the genre faced personal, political and social moral dilemma on how best to portray the intensely personal yet estranged issue of slavery in the colonies. Said, in his book Culture and Imperialism, highlights the implications of such an impasse. Many writers, including Austen, used ""striking but careful strategies...positive ideas of home, of a nation and its language, of proper order, good behaviour and moral values. But positive ideas of this sort do more than validate 'our' world; they also tend to devalue other worlds."" Similarly, texts written by ex slaves also encountered difficulties on how to portray their experiences of slavery. Whether the purpose of a text was abolitionist propaganda or personal catharsis, an ex slave had to safeguard against offending a reader's sensibilities, whilst also pushing the boundaries on descriptions of slavery, so readers did not become complacent and continued to argue in favour of abolition. These tensions established a fine balance between the sublimation and disruption of slavery in Romantic texts.

The paper explores the varying reasons as to why people will work hard but also how these reasons can be interpreted negatively resulting in a weakened will to work hard. Prior to the Industrial Revolution in the Great Britain the world of work was rather more subsistent and consequently relaxed. Scientific management was non existent and the only reason for working was to support ones self or family. However, during the Industrial Revolution the reason for working, the view of work and the very will of people was dramatically influenced and ultimately changed.

Methods are usually naturalistic and involve observing behaviour without manipulating variables. Qualitative methods are often thus considered less scientific than quantitative methods, yet they play a vital role in understanding behaviour in its natural environment and are frequently used to develop hypotheses and theories, giving exploratory analysis which can aid quantitative experimental design. Due to the inductive nature of qualitative research, however, it can only be a useful medium when explored in sufficient detail; therefore validity and reliability are critical to its utility. Since qualitative research differs so greatly from quantitative study, researchers have developed non-quantitative criteria for assessing reliability and validity. For instance, Guba and Lincoln, (1994), proposed four criteria for judging the soundness of qualitative research, e.g. as repeated observations of the same events are impossible (reliability), qualitative methods must show dependability and the research must account for how changes in context produced changes in observation.

Owing to its erstwhile conquering successes, Spain had an established tradition of assimilation, bringing conquered peoples under the crown's jurisdiction through conversion and allegiance to the Catholic Church. The notion of a 'spiritual conquest' pertained to the degree to which, following initial military and political subjugation, the colonists were able to proselytize the various indigenous inhabitants of its newly acquired regions. By the time of the conquest of Peru however, enthusiasm for evangelization had declined markedly within the Church and governmental authorities, with circumstances in Peru itself further constraining the enactment of a theological conquest. Internecine feuding, sustained Indian insurgency, and an inauspicious set of geographical facets meant that indigenous groups largely retained their traditional spiritual tenets in the initial years.

Much of the aforementioned label associated with Ranke arises from the symbol that he became rather than what he actually wrote. Hans Scheier has argued that it was this legacy that distorted the definition of scientific history, whereby it became ""a search for facts alone, with no laws or generalisations with a renunciation of all philosophy"".

The debate concerning the EU's legitimacy is generally centred on two main normative conceptions of governance in Europe. Firstly, the ardently supranational, state-centric approach, which attacks the legitimacy of the Union for lacking the qualities that constitute liberal-democratic nation states - the only truly legitimate political organisation in European thought to hold the allegiance of the masses. And, secondly, the functional, regulatory-type, multi-level governance approach that criticises the EU's dubious legitimacy since it has ventured beyond rational, pragmatic association and clashed with the nation state. Overall, effective assessments of arguably the most crucial aspect of legitimacy - identity - are rare. From both perspectives, the establishment of a European identity which recognises the EU as a legitimate polity, either in the United States of Europe, federalist sense, or in the multi-level governance sense of rationally divided competencies between various levels of government, identity is critical.

Introduction</heading>This essay begins with brief descriptions of two approaches to investigating males' and females' ways of talking, the variationist's and the language and gender approaches. It then concentrates on language and gender by discussing the theories of deficiency, dominance, and difference and considers the concepts of language as a gendered system and communicative competence where they provide an analytical tool for investigating these theories. Exampled are investigations and resulting suggestions for differences found. Also considered is the relatively new post-modern, or social constructionist, perspective.

BAWE,BAWE_1094,"Is it possible to be an error theorist without claiming that all moral judgements are false? If so, how? If not, why not?","In general terms, the study of morality concerns an enquiry into how we ought to conduct our lives in terms of right and wrong actions. This is the domain of normative ethics. Distinct from normative ethics, the field of meta-ethics concerns the nature and grounding of our moral belief systems, and essentially attempts to define our notion of morality by appealing to beliefs and attitudes. One such much debated meta-ethical idea is that of error-theory. Error theory can be directly contrasted with non-naturalist moral realism. Both these meta-ethical theories hold that when we make a moral judgement, we are expressing a belief about non-natural properties. The difference between the two lies in the fact that realists hold that these non-natural properties exist, whereas error theorists hold that they don't. Before we get into a critical discussion it is helpful to understand a little about 'beliefs' and 'non-natural properties'. A belief is an attempt at representing the world as it actually is, thus we can either hold true beliefs or false beliefs. A non-natural property is a property of the world that cannot be discovered through the usual method one employs in order to discover a natural property, namely through scientific...","You are a university student.

In his world culture and art no longer existed. Truth had been sacrificed for technological progress. Society existed only to perpetuate the status quo, controlled by sophisticated methods of science and censorship. Around the same time, the Frankfurt School were formulating their ideas that our world was not so dissimilar to Huxley's nightmarish creation. The founding authors of the Frankfurt School were Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse. This essay will explore their thoughts and theories on the 'culture industry'; a concept worked out by Horkheimer and Adorno in the 1930s. The 'culture industry' is the culmination of a number of ontological ideas running throughout the Frankfurt Schools thought. A brief genealogy of the Frankfurt is a prudent place to begin, from this, the concepts essential to their ideas will be examined. Their arguments are those of 'totality', technological domination, and to a certain degree a functionalist critique of societal mechanisms that reproduce and create social control.

BAWE,BAWE_964,What is the effect of the social variables of class and gender on the way we speak? Is there a link between them?,"For years, linguists and sociologists have been researching the linguistic variables that are related to the sociological characteristics of speakers of language and what makes them varied. This is important because it implies that there are different factors that affect the way people speak, and that there is a variety of language used among people in society. In this essay, I intend to look at different social variables of gender and class, such as geographical factors and different language use, to try and find out if they have an effect on the way people speak. Also, if there is linguistic variation between gender and class. Gender refers to the social, cultural and psychological differences that occur between men and women. It should not be confused with sex, which is associated with the biological and anatomical differences between men and women. In 1975, Robin Lakoff carried out a study that looked at gender differences in the context of the courtroom and at how women spoke differently compared to men. There are certain features which women use. Women use speech such as hedges, which consist of not saying anything definite such as 'sort of', polite speech, tag questions, such as, he was...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_402,Discuss the distinction between the two multiplicities in Time and Free Will. What work is this doing in Bergson's argument for duration?,"The distinction between the two multiplicities is central to Bergson's concept of duration. I shall try to show that the second multiplicity is a problematic schema. As the second multiplicity defines the nature of pure duration, I shall evaluate whether the concept of duration is dealt a fatal blow by the difficulties. The term 'multiplicity' is to be used to understand the origins of the concepts of one and many, and the relations between the two. The second multiplicity can be considered an attempt to subvert the intuitive understanding of those two concepts that is better captured by the first multiplicity. The first multiplicity Bergson deals with is defined with reference to extension and number. Extension is for Bergson pure quantity without quality. That is to say that extension can only be expressed mathematically. To give something's extension is to define it using co-ordinates; to express its internal relations that way is to measure its size, to express its external relationships in such a manner is to express its location. Extension is thus intrinsically connected to the concept of number. For Bergson, every number is an implicit multiplicity.

Russell, recognising China's essential differences to the West, asks whether China can retain its 'virtues' without being forced to adopt the 'model' of ""all the foreign nations with which she has dealings"", a question that is just as relevant today. In the last decade, economic importance on the world stage has increased dramatically, to an extent at which even Russell might be surprised. Economic reforms have been implemented rapidly since Deng Xiaoping's exhortation to the people that ""to get rich is glorious"" leading to its powerful current position, where it stands to overtake the US as the world's largest economy by 2020. The extent of China's influence is easy to see, with their fuel needs pushing up oil prices, their cheap goods fuelling consumption and their huge markets for an ever increasing number of goods fuelling demand for foreign manufacturers, the Chinese economy is playing an increasingly large role on the world stage, a fact that has not escaped the notice...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_236,To what extent did the Romantic Movement pave the way for modern environmentalism?,"The epoch of the Romantic Movement has been a topic of notable discussion, however it is generally postulated that it spanned the period between the mid-eighteenth and mid-nineteenth century, triumphing particularly in its later years. The Romantic Movement symbolised a momentous reaction against the degrading material and environmental changes stimulated by the centuries' industrial and agricultural revolutions, alongside a rejection of the rational dogmas of the Enlightenment. The principal characteristics of the Romantic Movement included an overpowering yet troubled love of nature, sympathy and nostalgia for a golden past, and enthusiasm for a simple rural life. A combination of these elements provided the impetus in paving the way for modern environmentalism, because of their connection to the supreme force of Mother Nature and endeavours to protect her dominion. Although it is 'difficult to place the commencement of modern concerns about the environment to any specific date', modern environmentalism evolved as a mass movement since Earth Day, in 1970. Although an understanding of environmental issues had been accumulating throughout the century, this national celebration underlined the fact that modern society was growing increasingly conscious of the threat posed by the profound environmental problems that stemmed from adverse developments in the economy....",You are a university student.

In his epic form he proposed a theatre which would not be 'dramatic', full of tensions and conflicts, but slower-paced, giving time to reflect and compare.

They were perceived as being merely driven by emotion and not reason. In this sense, women who had to work were paid less than men, and those who didn't work at all were reliant on a husband, a father or perhaps some generous male relative for any financial support. Women were victims of this patriarchal society and perhaps this is why Barbara Bodichon states so strongly that women held no importance or status in Victorian society, other than dutifully fulfilling the role of wife and mother and becoming the property of the their husbands. Bodichon herself was a victim of this society's rules and expectations regarding women, yet she did not submit herself or conform to them, rather Bodichon challenged and confronted, campaigning for women's rights and even set up the first women's suffrage committee 1866.

The countries hit hardest by this economic catastrophe were Germany and America as both countries had experienced similar prosperity and growth in the 1920s. Thus it was in these countries where long-standing socio-political and economic relationships were shook to their foundations; resulting in the installation of two new but very different regimes. This essay compares the social policies of Hitler's Nazi government with the New Deal policies of Roosevelt's Democratic government from 1932 to 1937. There are obvious fundamental differences between these two administrations as they emerged from countries with very different historical cultural development. Moreover they represented opposing ideologies and political systems with the Hitler destroying and Roosevelt upholding democratic institutions. However, prevailing historical accounts have highlighted strikingly similarities between the New Deal and Nazi socio-economic policies (Garraty 1973).

Although Marx did not provide explicit definition for class, in classic Marxist terms, it is indicated as the relationship of the exploiter and the exploited to the meaning of production (Havelkova, 1999). Warde (1994) preferred to link class to exclusion and deprivation than occupation and education, and claimed that it persisted over time even when occupation or household composition changed. On the contrary, Crompton (1998), without denying its influence by some traditional structures of inequality factors, tended to describe class as a modern phenomenon, which is ""a major organizing concept in the exploration of contemporary stratification system"". In this essay, class has used to present, according to Crompton (1998), material structures and symbolic inequality, together with to illustrate social forces which are capable to transform society. Identity is often defined in the contrast to the other (Wilson, 2002), that is, distinctive ways of seeing themselves in relation to others.

However, a natural language is not so perfectly designed to transfer all the information in an expected way. More or less, some flaws in a language are inevitable, such as the ambiguity of a language which causes confusion in people's common utterances. Generally speaking, there are often certain ambiguous words and sentences appearing in human's utterances and acquiring more precise clarification from speakers. Different interpretations of the same utterance may result in various interpretations and the difficulty of comprehension of listeners. It is, actually, a quite common phenomenon among different languages. The purpose of this essay is to identify the types of ambiguity because sometimes it could be confusing in itself and with other phenomena.

Nonsense is only described as such because it does not fit into a recognized system in our minds, or it subverts a system we are familiar with. That is not to say it is chaos, rather, it operates under its own rules and within its own system so that something understood as nonsense in a wider field of literature may make perfect sense if we address it as nonsense.

I will explain why I believe that, despite controversy, qualitative methods can be valid and reliable whilst highlighting the care psychologists need to take to use them affectively. I will conclude by explaining how qualitative methods can best be used in psychological research. Burt and Oaksford* (1999) say scientific research involves experimentation to test a hypothesis. However, whilst in long-established physical sciences such as chemistry, 'the depth of knowledge from past theorising constrains the choice of sensible hypotheses,' psychology remains a relatively 'new' science (Burt & Oaksford*, 1999). They argue that qualitative methods are essential when generating hypothesis for research in new fields, which we are interested in but unsure which questions to ask. Without them, we could only resort to an 'armchair technique'; reading limited existing literature, then 'sitting around' waiting for a hypothesis to strike you (Burt & Oaksford*, 1999).

Discuss this statement with reference to two communication disorders.,"Linguistics, the scientific study of language, is essential in the field of speech and language pathology. It provides the foundation in understanding the nature and causes of communication disorders. In carrying out clinical work, linguistic knowledge is applied in identifying and assessing speech and language disorders in children and adults, as well as in planning and performing appropriate therapeutic interventions. Linguistic theories provided a distinction between speech and language. Saussure, the founder of modern linguistics, contributed the basis of explaining spoken communication. Speech is a physiological act made by an individual, which results in the production of physical sound waves that is considered of having concrete existence. Language is a psychological abstract that does not have substance but exist as a 'form' in the shared knowledge of a linguistic community. Within language, it can be divided into two aspects, language execution (expression) and language reception (comprehension) (Grundy, 1995). Thus, speech impairment can be differentiated from language impairment. Assessment and diagnosis of speech and language disorders is built on the linguistic-descriptive approach. The method is based on describing language, using metalanguage, at different levels of the linguistic hierarchy. The frame work of linguistic components is illustrated in Figure 1 (adapted from...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_912,When did the early state emerge in mainland Greece and what form did it take?,"<heading>1. Introduction</heading>The archaeology of the Bronze Age of the Greek mainland has traditionally entailed attempts to confirm the Homeric texts, stylistic comparisons of architecture, artistic appreciations of finds and detailed examinations of pottery in order to achieve chronological refinements. The notion of the 'state' in archaeology implicates evolutionary thinking and theories influenced by the social and biological sciences (Chapman, 2003). However, the term 'state' has advantages over the traditional approaches. It can prove to be a useful analytical tool for understanding the structure of mainland societies as it encompasses specific organisational attributes. In order to address the first part of the question it is necessary to identify the point in time when states become visible archaeologically. Since complex chiefdoms exemplify social inequality and a hierarchical structure, these can be regarded as precursors to state societies (Flannery, 1999: 4). Therefore, one needs to ascertain when mainland societies had clearly passed the 'threshold' from chiefdom to statehood. Consequently, the early state can be defined as the first state to emerge following the chiefdom mode of organisation. It ought to be emphasised that the definition of 'early state' within archaeology is a contested issue. Smith (2003: 17, 19, 87, 275, 277) rightly stresses...",You are a university student.

In particular a few key events such as the Jonestown massacre 1978 pushed the followers of these movements into the headlines. To consider what is meant by a 'new religious movement' perhaps the best definition is that of Barker.

Government policies and targeted funding programmes, as well as employers' calls for an increasingly skilled, knowledgeable and mobile workforce, have promoted lifelong learning to a must status rather than an optional one (Edwards 1997). Benefits of lifelong learning are expounded by governments, policy-makers and adult educators alike (Merrill 2000) and there has been disagreement amongst many regarding the extensive initiatives to promote lifelong learning and ""widen participation"" and the prominent reasons for this ie for economic or social benefits. Economic theorists argue for the need to move with changing times in order to remain competitive in the market place eg by accessing employment or career progression (Fryer 1997). Social benefits can be varied and difficult to measure, but much support is shown for using lifelong learning to improve the individual's well being eg in improved self-confidence (Merrill 2000), creating more tolerance of today's multi-cultural society in which we live (Feinstein 2002), or becoming an active citizen (Fryer 1997, Martin 2003).

I will be using secondary sources, including Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars. Gladiatorial combat was an extremely popular and brutal sport in the Ancient Roman World. Gladiators would fight as part of religious festivals or to celebrate important dates in the Roman calendar. The competitions did not only take place in the city of Rome, but were instead held throughout the empire, even in the small towns. The fighting was carried out in amphitheatres, large and significant structures that could hold the majority of a town's population. The combat itself varied in size and spectacle, from individual hand to hand combat between a small group of men, to a great naval battle held by ""Titus, who flooded the newly built Colosseum in AD80 to stage a sea fight and other water-borne displays"" (The Roman World 44BC- AD180 by Martin Goodman with the assistance of Jane Sherwood, Routledge, 1997, p189) The fighting also often involved animals.

As medical students we are taught how to commence a medical relationship with a patient in great detail.

The manner in which a doctor frames the human response to human finitude has important consequences for the life-threatened, the terminally ill, their family members and the doctor themselves. The science of thanatology is the study of death and dying, loss and grief. Topics related to thanatology are primarily covered during semester one in the human diversity module.

In light of studies centred around Robin Dunbar, it appears geladas are balanced on an evolutionary threshold, the point where primate grooming is longer sufficiently efficient as the principle cognitive mechanism for social bonding due to their unusually large 'cognitive' group sizes in gelada societies. Indeed it appears there has been sufficient selective pressure for the adaptation of 'vocal grooming' to arise, which could provide a clue to the evolutionary origins of human language. <picture/></abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>Many theories of the origin of language tend to focus on the way language is designed to subserve its primary purpose, that is the communication of information (Pinker 1994), much in the way of; ""there are mammoths beyond that hill right now"", or ""this is how you made a hand axe"". There are several problems with placing the evolutionary determinant basis on this cognitive function alone: Studies of what people actually talk about in both modern societies (Dunbaral. 1997) and in more traditional ones (Haviland 1991) suggest most conversations revolve around social topics.

This is not surprising as the USA is the largest economy in the world and has a pivotal role in the running of the world economy. For this reason, it is vital for scholars of economics to study how the US economy is driven. What goes on in the USA does not only affect the domestic economy but influences almost all economies in the world. Following a decade marked by the longest US expansion on record, the US economy slipped into recession in early 2001. This recent slowdown has had a major impact upon almost all economies of the world. In order to evaluate the reasons why this had occurred, it is vital to examine what had occurred coming up to the year 2001.

Introduction</heading>In the multitude of semantic relations that can exist between words, the phenomena of polysemy and homonymy are not the only ones with overlapping boundaries and fuzzy edges. But to assign a case of ""one word, more than one meaning"" to one of those categories often seems more difficult than to determine cases of synonymy, oppositeness or hyponymy, for example. This is even more unfortunate given that this particular difference is so important for every lexicographer, as they have to decide whether to file the different meanings associated with one particular word as one entry or separate entries. This paper takes a look at possible approaches to distinguish cases of homonymy from cases of polysemy and aims to evaluate them according to their effectiveness and coherence.

This view, and the more recent revisionist view of the topic in question has informed the main body of debate in scholarly circles, but before embarking on the essay, there are a few points that deserve attention. Firstly, the question suggests that what was 'wrong' with the Church could have led, in some sort of linear equation, to the birth of the Reformation. Following in the footsteps of Peter Marshall, ""the intention is not to sift the evidence for signs of impending Reformation"", and teleological history should be avoided due to the inaccurate interpretations and conclusions which may emerge from that approach.

Simply speaking, it should be a combination of nation economies which are originally based on individual nation states. Then what is nation state? Basically, nation state refers to a national government, who has a unified administration on politics, economy, law and culture within the borders of a defined territory. However, the connotation of world economy is in fact much broader than a simple summation of nation economies, as it has been undergoing a profound transformation. One of the most popular terms used to characterise the world economy in current times is economic 'globalization', which means an internationally integrated market, within which businesses are operated as if national borders did not exist. As Ohmae (2000: 207) put it, 'in terms of real flows of economic activity, nation states have already lost their role as meaningful units of participation in the global economy of today's borderless world'. Therefore, a serious issue that globalization has resulted in the decline of nation state power has aroused worldwide concerns.

For instance, Marx's analysis of the relationship between capital and labour opened many people's eyes to the injustice inherent within capitalism and provided the working class inspiration to free themselves from the shackles of exploitation, and likewise the myriad feminist interpretations of society have provided people with not only the knowledge that gross inequities between men and women exists, but also the belief that they should be eradicated. Thus assessing the contribution of all the disparate strands of feminism is important as it can allow feminists to see what their predecessors had and had not succeeded in challenging and in turn decide what would be the most efficacious direction for the movement(s) to take in the Twenty-First century. In this essay the analysis will be confined to the effects of the discourses that are part of the feminist 'second-wave.'

Emphasis thereby is often laid on his concept of a 'general will', through which personal liberty is handed over to the collective. 'The citizens having but one interest', Rousseau argues, 'the people [have] but a single will'. And although Rousseau favours the ballot vote, he argues for the infallibility of its ruling: 'when the opinion contrary to my own prevails, it proves nothing more than that I made a mistake, and that what I took to be the general will was not'. From the point of view of Rousseau, most importantly protection should be rendered against the emergence of a minority rule, or 'particular will', rather than against the state, which, after all, represents the sovereignty of the lawgiver as it corresponds with the community's best interest, the general will.

Towards this end, it is interesting to note Hamber and van der Merwe's identification of at least five different understandings of the concept of reconciliation in South Africa, non-racial, intercommunal, religious, human rights, and community building; these ideologies may comfortably co-exist, but have been at the core of conflict between different groups during the process of the TRC. This theory is useful in our present context as it provides the basis of one of the ways in which the various grounds of criticisms levelled against the TRC may be categorised. The dissatisfaction that a particular individual, group or institution might express towards the work of the TRC, based upon its predominant ideology of reconciliation, does not necessarily translate into dissatisfaction with the performance of the TRC but possibly with one or more of the principles that it bases itself upon, such as its use of the language of Christian forgiveness, to name just one example. <fnote>Borer, Tristan Anne,...",You are a university student.

These policies did not take into account the country's reality and the result was an increase in poverty and inequality, creating a contingent of rural unemployed people. The peasants could not be incorporated into the urban workforce for two main reasons: lack of formal education and lack of jobs, since the cities were also suffering the consequences of the SAPs. The MST seized the opportunity and recruited almost 70,000 landless families, enlarging by 466.36 percent in a decade.

Teachers draw upon the National Curriculum for guidance about what scientific concepts should be taught and to what age group they should be aimed at. In order to provide teachers with appropriate guidance, developers of curricula can refer to empirical evidence and theories about cognitive development. One of the first major theories of cognitive development was devised by Piaget. He saw development as taking place in four stages; the sensorimotor stage, the preoperational stage, the concrete operational stage and the formal operational stage (Harris & Butterworth, 2002). Piaget devised tests to determine what stage particular children were in. These tests included assessing children's knowledge of specific scientific concepts. Many later experiments, however, contradicted Piaget's findings, as will be discussed later, and other theories of cognitive development were proposed, including that of Vygotsky and the information-processing approach. Piaget's theory has been directly applied to the equivalent to the national curriculum in America (Good, 1977) and there have been consistent findings that children are taught concepts far in advance of what Piaget would suggest for their age group.

Consequently, we look at whether the connection is sufficient for us to maintain that knowing the truth conditions in question is sufficient for meaning. The paper is divided into several parts. A brief account of the Davidsonian Theory of meaning seems the best starting point as it aims to explaining meaning of all sentences in terms of truth conditions. Furthermore, the theory provides a framework for the rest of the essay. Secondly we examine what exactly is problematic when analysing meaning of Q&C in terms of TC. Consequently, several solutions trying to show how a truth conditional theory of meaning can explain meaning of questions and commands are suggested. We start by looking at ways to interpret Q&C in order to make the TC account applicable. Secondly, we look at the truth-like bi-polar values of Q&C and lastly, we try to use the concept of inference to deal with semantic multi-polarity of possible answers to Questions. The thesis of this paper is that it seems common sensual that assertions made by Q&C are not...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_749,No title,"From the late eighteenth until the early nineteenth century, typically known as the 'Romantic' period in the history of literature, nature was used by poets to express to reader's notions and ideas that could not be expressed in the restricted 'rational' terms of conventional forms of writing which had preceded them. This previous preoccupation with rational thought can explain why a mass of critical opinion towards Romantic poetry at the time was seen simply as nature writing. The above quotation attempts to explain that the presentation of nature in Romantic writing is dependent on how it is perceived and interpreted, the 'observing consciousness' being not only that of the writer, but also in the reader's subjective inference. With this in mind, it is easy to see from a critical perspective that a poet's 'overflowing of spontaneous emotion' (Wordsworth, 1798, 22) could have been the product of the direct influence of nature. However, this opinion views descriptions of nature in poetry as 'a principle order, of which the ordering mind is part' (Williams, 1985, 13), but what Romantic poetry typically embodied was the portrayal of nature as a 'principle of creation, of which the creative mind is a part' (13).

BAWE,BAWE_742,The Romantic Period is often classed as one of 'Revolutions'. What literary revolutions occur during the period?,"The term 'Romanticism' was not recognised as a distinct movement or object of study until the late nineteenth century. During this period there were a number of revolutions, political, cultural and literary. However, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron Shelley and Keats, often referred to as the 'big six' by no means regarded themselves as a unified group and were actually much divided in their political, religious and artistic beliefs. John Blades notes that whilst these recognisable figures of Romantic poetry were aware of each others' work, ""they did not form a recognisable group with anything like a united artistic manifesto."" They did, however, share a strong opposition to the rigid and artificial diction of the Neo-Classical literary movement of the eighteenth century and strove to create poetry which would illustrate ""a natural delineation of human passions, human characters and human incidents."" Politically, the Romantics were against authoritarian government and favoured democracy. They were also attracted to Rousseau and Godwin's campaigns in the cause of humanity. Emotionally, they expressed an extreme assertion of the self, the value of individual experience and the dynamic nature of the imagination. <fnote>John Blades Analysing Texts: John Keats The Poems ( Hampshire, Palgrave: 2002) p.201 </fnote><fnote>William Wordsworth...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_302,"Why is Keynes often seen as continuing the 'classical political economy' tradition, rather than fitting within the neo-classical economics tradition?","To deliberate whether John Maynard Keynes was a classical or neo-classical economist is essentially to compare the two traditions in light of Keynes' theories. This essay will consider how Keynes' thought compares with either school. Above this analysis it is equally important to interpret Keynes general approach to the study of economics. The tradition of the classical political economy should be taken synonymous with the liberal critique of mercantilism and the analyses of the advantages of international trade. In this way, the neo-classical economy further advocated the principles of free trade within British hegemony in the 19 th century. The approach of the neo-classical marginalist revolution signaled a specialization of economics as a purely technical discipline. As Michael Bleaney comments, 'Keynes' achievement was to bridge the gulf between these practical ideas and pure neo-classical theory; to root these thoughts in a new general theory of economics'. Hence, Keynes' writing was composed of a mélange of classical and neo-classical ideas. Yet, his approach to the study of economics most closely resembles the classical consideration of a political economy. These arguments of theory and approach will be brought forward hereinafter. <fnote>Bleaney, p.1 </fnote>It is essential to compare the two strands of liberal...","You are a university student.

How do they challenge these stereotypes?,"Human societies have always been obsessed with the natures and roles of male and female throughout our history and this is evident in no one society more so than that of the Greeks, most notably that of the Athenians. Considering the political and militaristic dominance of Athens in Greek history it is not surprising that the majority of Greek mythological evidence that we have today originated from the very same place. Before we begin to discuss the application of the gender stereotypes in relation to various examples of Greek mythology I believe it would be intelligent to define what we mean by stereotypes and to examine the specific way in which the sexes were seen in ancient society. It should be stressed that a stereotype is not a fact; it is not what something is but what a majority perceives it to be or what a majority believes it should be. Therefore since Athens was a heavily patriarchal society where women were marginalised and for the most part uneducated, the perceptions we have of women from that era are deeply biased. The basic stereotype we have of an Athenian woman was what, according to Athenian men, she should endeavour to...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_238,"In what ways did religion affect the lives of people in early modern Europe, c.1500?","Religion permeated all spheres of daily existence in early modern Europe, playing an indispensable role in society, culture, economics and politics. Thus sixteenth-century religion had a widespread affect on people's lives that cannot be underestimated. However, a pessimistic tone has often prevailed in the historiography of early modern religion from historians of the traditional school of thought, for instance Johan Huizinga and A. G. Dickens. They believe that the era was marked by a decline in the late medieval Church, in comparison to the flourishing religion of the high Middle Ages, which evoked widespread discontent. This outlook implies that religion did not have a resounding affect on people's lives, and when it did it was predominantly negative and may have resulted in people abandoning or reforming their faith. On the other hand, revisionist historians, such as Eamon Duffy and Christopher Haigh in their studies of England and A. J. Bijsterveld who has examined religion on the continent, have adopted a more optimistic approach. They believe late medieval religion exhibited signs of vitality, and discontent with the Church was not as extensive as had been previously suggested. <fnote>Johan Huizinga, The Waning of the Middle Ages: a Study of Forms of Life,...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_830,Discuss the representation and use of childhood in literature of the Romantic Period,"Unlike the Augustinian poets of the eighteenth century, who strove to provide a generalized picture of experience and emotion, and to bring out what an experience had in common with all other such experiences, the Romantic movement in the nineteenth-century placed an emphasis on confronting 'each reader individually, with a representation of the poet's individuality."" At a time when 'mathematical thinking was the dominant intellectual mode' due to the influence of Isaac Newton's scientific findings, both William Wordsworth and William Blake strove to reach a more natural and humanistic state in their poetry, and to focus 'particularly on those aspects... which transcended or escaped the ordered patternings of mathematical form."" During the nineteenth-century the state of childhood was linked to the 'tender infantile sentiment appropriate to that perennial image of meekness;' therefore in order to get back to what the poets considered to be a 'truer state of humanity' and closer to a child-like state it is natural that the Romantic Poets should hold up the image of youth as an ideal condition, in order to connect more deeply with their reading public. <fnote>A.

BAWE,BAWE_442,Containment or Engagement? A Critical Analysis of Approaches towards the North Korea Nuclear Crisis,"<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>The approach to the North Korea nuclear crisis requires a more balanced and historically aware perspective in order that North Korea can be constructively engaged. One only has to listen to the multitudinous and compelling invocations from the top authorities on the subject in academe and the policymakers of the past, armed with the enlightenment of hindsight, to be confident that seeking to wholeheartedly engage North Korea may prove worthwhile. In an analysis of approaches toward the crisis it is important to look at how crucial events in recent years have unfolded, how policymakers have managed them, and how they have been conceptualised by erudite observers. Almost without exception in the latter case there is a belief that the essential security fears of the D.P.R.K regime have been neglected and thus the crisis continues. Even pessimistic assessments assert that some form of engagement is superior to a policy of coercion or neglect which will simply force the Kim regime to take more desperate measures to survive. North Korea must be made to feel that incentives are more advantageous than coercive bargaining, which will potentially jeopardise its relatively propitious position. In the final assessment it must be understood that 'without resolving...",You are a university student. Write an essay on the topic Containment or Engagement?

BAWE,BAWE_577,Analyse the ways in which the image of the 'street waif' was constructed and to what intent.,"The Victorian period saw a pilferer of different art forms emerging which depicted the street children that had become common throughout the urban areas of the country. The focus of both the art world and the development of philanthropy had a wide range of intentions, which throughout the period provided both constructive and unconstructive contributions towards solving the problem of the destitution of these children. Many literary and artistic forms of this kind maintained the middle class as it emerged during the process of industrialisation. Whilst, in contrast, it is clear that other artists aimed to construct the image of the 'street waif' with the aim to address the poverty and victimisation suffered by these children within Victorian society. A strong middle class agenda that aimed to maintain their own self-definition and class values is a prominent reason for the consistent construction of the image of the street child as a 'nuisance' (Steedman, 1995) or an immoral character. The construction of the 'street waif' was often in stark contrast to the values of the Victorian middle class that upheld the class distinction.

BAWE,BAWE_75,What was revolutionary about the French Revolution?,"In order to examine this question, it is important to establish what the term ""revolutionary"" actually means - a change that can be considered groundbreaking, which has never been experienced before, fundamentally altering the current situation. Therefore, it would be fair to argue that there were many things that were revolutionary about the French Revolution which occurred in 1789 that included not just legal and political changes, introduced for the first time in French society, totally reforming it, but also a whole new way of thinking that was influential in causing the Revolution and implementing these changes in the first place. These new ideas first came about during the middle of the eighteenth-century during a period known as Enlightenment. This essay will attempt to outline the major revolutionary changes that occurred during the French Revolution. However, the general focus of the essay will be on the early years of the Revolution because it could be argued that the it lasted until 1815 with the fall of Napoleon and covering this whole period would be both unfeasible and lacking in depth for such a short essay.

(Harrisoeschylus, Eumenides) Explore the ways two dramatists studied this term explore questions of guilt and punishment.","In the exploration of punishment in Greek tragedy, the targeted characters are ones of power; kings and the divine with the authority to administrate punishment to the guilty. Guilt commonly follows crime or sin and the level of justice in the given punishment must be assessed. For example, while a punishment is directed at a single person, it often affects the lives of many, which increases the severity of this penalty. The level of justice will assess the ability of people in power to make judgement and decisions. Euripides' Bacchae and Sophocles' Antigone display the capability of both man and the divine to error but the consistency lies in the authority of the gods. While man can be judged, the gods are the highest level of authority and are therefore able to design an image of justice that cannot be challenged by man. These are both fierce and bloody plays that do not attempt to disguise the conflicts between men, in the case of Antigone, while the dissonance lies between god and men in Euripides' tragedy.

Central to this analysis has been an examination of the various sites of meaning surrounding visual imagery, in particular their production, consumption and intended audience(s). With these sites in mind, a still photograph taken from a published autobiography of Alison Lapper 'My Life in My Hands' (2005) will be examined. Alison Lapper was born without arms and with shortened legs, and the photograph to be examined was one taken of her at some point between the ages of three and five during which time she was institutionalised in a children's home for the disabled and subject to regular medical examinations and photography in order to assess and 'correct' her 'deformities'.

This imposition, however, is informal, not through an agreement as it was the case with the IFIs. Governments, however, are not innocent in this game.

Several theories have been suggested as to why human beings are attracted to others essentially the origins of affiliation.
