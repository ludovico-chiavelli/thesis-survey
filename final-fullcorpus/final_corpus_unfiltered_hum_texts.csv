I separated it in three categories: difficulties, responsibilities and attitude to people. The first one is about dealing with hard and tough situations. A leader should calculate the risks without forgetting the future. secondly, he should know that his decisions can have bad consequences. Although it's unpleasant to accept, a leader must take full responsibilities. In addition, he needs to learn from his mistakes. The final aspect is a strong commitment to people, which is the core of any business. His main function is to create a collaborative workgroup that anyone feels comfortable to give ideas and feedbacks.

A plain, black coffee is usually much cheaper than a latte but it can still give you a boost in the morning. 2. taking a lunch at home and then bring it to work: instead of buying somethings expensive and unhealthy for lunch, why don't you try to make a lunch at home and bring it to work? In this way, you can save not only money but also health. A sandwich may be a good choice because it is easy to make and carry with. 3. reducing the frequency of dinning out and the level of restaurant: How about dinning out with friends after work once a week in a cheaper restaurant? You can save a lot of money but will still be able to maintain the friendship. I hope you find them helpful. Best Ivory Tsar",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

I noticed your issue to cut down expenses on food, and I think you are right if you choose to do so. I would like to give you my opinions for your advice, which I hope will be helpful to you. First you may get up just a little earlier than you did so that you have enough time to have a decent but less expensive breakfast instead of a double latte coffee drink, which is an expensive habit for breakfast. I noticed you like meeting friends after work. It is quite good to make friends and have fun meeting friends and it is ok if you go to the best restaurants for drinks and nice dinners from time to time other than often. But I have to say everything must be subject to a degree and it would not be good when going too far. With your new less-paying job, you do need to start economizing not only for going through the current hard time but also for long-term financial preparedness. wish you the best luck!",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

EFCAMDAT,EF_51,Giving advice about budgeting,"Dear Paula, Thank you for your question. There are plenty of ways to cut down on spending not only on food but on the issues as well. speaking of food, you should try to cook your food yourself instead of going to cafes and restaurants, or buying it in the street. Of house, a latte coffee drink is not easy to make at home and it takes some time, but you can get more pleasure if you drink it lying in your bed and watching TV. As for lunch, it is not so difficult to cook it in the evening and bring it to work next day. For sure, it will be healthier than something you buy at the shop for your lunch. Last but not least, you can have your dinner with your friends at their premises. You can either cook dinner together and enjoy it or cook dinner in turn to see who is a better cook. Hope you will find the advice useful. regards, Victoria",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English. You are currently at B1 level.

EFCAMDAT,EF_51,Giving advice about budgeting,"Paula, I have some tips that can help you reduce your spending. instead of buying a coffee drink every morning on your way to work, you can drink the coffee at home made by you. You can buy healthy food in a supermarket and cook it at home. You can place the food in a bowl and take it to work to be eaten in your lunch break. Another tip I can give you is to explain your friends your financial situation so they can understand why you can't meet them after work to have drinks and dinner. You can invite your friends once a month to your house to have dinner made by you. You can also ask them to bring beverages and desserts.

I believe we can make an educational product for kids, fun for the whole family! Kids can learn fun and interesting facts about animals in various habitats. cards are easy to handle and feature animals in full-color on one side, and class, habitat, location, size, diet, body covering and fun fact on the other side. Early learners can do simple sorting and classifying while more advanced students learn about animals. students learn about a range of wildlife in various settings. combine all four sets for classroom fun. reaching card included.

Our local climate with many sunny days is beneficial for this technology. It is possible to install solar panels on all roof-types or mobile devices like traffic signs. In addition they can be tailored for large solar farms. furthermore I want to highlight its technical robustness. A failure in one installation does not harm the whole city as it would be the case for the other technologies.

In solar energy the energy from the sun gets converted into thermal or electrical energy by the use of solar panels. The photons are being transformed into conduction electrons.solar panels can be installed on the roofs or residential homes. residents can use solar energy for appliances. It requires preferably high quality solar panels, lots of sunlight, large surfaces to install solar panels and relatively high installation cost. It also requires regular maintenance like cleaning, short circuits, cracks,corrosion. It will cost the city US$ 120,000. Even though it costs a little higher than the other kind or energy resource, I think it is a safe investment because we have plenty of sunshine here and the possibility of shortage is limited.",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

EFCAMDAT,EF_57,Choosing a renewable energy source,"A renewable energy Source for So Paulo The energy in my city is from no renewable sources in 45% and the renewable sources correspond to 55%. Most of the energy renewable source is from hydroelectric power station. I think that this is the most suitable renewable energy source of my city because we have some powerful rivers here in the state and the cost is relatively low: no costs of fuel are required and the construction and maintenance compared to the amount of energy that can produce is very low. I like the idea of a solar power too. I think it could an option if you can afford it, individually. It could be used in the summer, when the sun is more constant, to spare some no renewable power. due to the fact that my city is in subtropical area, we couldn't be able to use solar power the whole year. Another option for renewable source for So Paulo is sugarcane energy. We have a lot of sugar cane production and its alcohol is largely used as car fuel nowadays.%% biomass energy is a good option in study by our government and the use of papers, building supplies, firewood, leaf, sawdust, could help us to make a good use of materials that would be considered trash.",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

EFCAMDAT,EF_57,Choosing a renewable energy source,"I'm a firm supporter of the idea that construction of a new building shouldn't begin without considering its environmental impact and the income it could give. In my opinion, my town could benefit from three different sources of renewable energy: solar power, wind power, and biomass recycling. solar energy has always been considered as a good, but expensive source of renewable energy. transformation of sun rays into feasible amount of power requires a lot of maintenance facilities to keep panels clean, safe, and working. This needs a lot of money, and I cannot be sure that in my town we have enough sun to keep such undertaking profitable. The same could be said about the wind power. Wind turbines are very expensive and their maintenance is a bit tricky. additionally, they are not that environmentally friendly due to the harmful fields they create. The last variant - biomass - is efficient, and doesnt require lots of money. I consider it to be the most prospective way to get cheap renewable energy in my town.",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English. You are currently at B1 level.

EFCAMDAT,EF_57,Choosing a renewable energy source,"Our town is not environmentally-friendly. We don't recycle, we don't have solar panels, we don't make large use of renewable energy. We are just starting making small steps, but we should do more. We live on an island, and we should do the impossible to protect the environment. But to protect it, we don't need to do the impossible. Just small things. If each of us do a single small thing, we could make big things together. We have a very hot climate all year long. solar panels installed on rooftops, for example, would be very useful to obtain energy that can be used in our daily activities. True, it will be costly, but in the long run, these costs will be amortized. Pus, do not forget we are surrounded by water. We should use tidal energy to convert the energy of tides into electricity.

EFCAMDAT,EF_57,Choosing a renewable energy source,"It is certainly not an easy task to choose whatever source of energy due to the fact that either of them have something positive and negative to offer. Having said that, I do believe that the only reasonable thing to do is to select one which offers a balance between benefits and damages caused to to nature. In the city where I live, So Paulo - Brazil, which is the 7th largest city in the world, if I am not mistaken, tons of waste is produced every minute and this could be a very intelligent way of getting renewable energy and yet contribute to preserve nature. We, citizens, usually tend to think that it is the government responsibility to take care of everything which involves the environment, and if this way of thinking does not change, we will lose everything we still have, which as a matter of fact is not much.

I know it's hard to manage a full-time job and do one's household chores. As I've suffered from stress for years, I can give you some advice how to avoid stress. First of all, try to think always positive. thinking in a positive way makes the difference and lets you feel much better. cry to organise your time. You'll see that organising your time at work as well as at home will make you feel less stressed. relax in clean and light-flooded rooms at home.

Then suddenly I noticed someone on the top of the building next to mine. It was a man trying to ride his unicycle across the narrow edge o the skyscraper. I screamed and called my colleagues over. It was so alarming, we didnt know what to do. I mean, the stunt was great but terribly dangerous. And everything happened really fast. What he did was, he got on the unicycle and rode it for a few meters. Then he lost his balance. He landed on the roof, but his unicycle fell all the way to the ground. The guy really lucked out. nobody on the ground was hurt by the unicycle. A big bowl of pudding that Puddilicious was using for marketing was broken by the unicycle, though. That made a huge mess in the street. A lot of money will be needed to repair the damage. It was the stunt mans fault, so I guess hes in a lot of trouble.

Her daughter now feels she gets attention from the mom and becomes more independent. She can concentrate on work and get more sleep. She no longer feels guilty about ignoring her daughter. She identified negative behaviors and positive intentions. She also applied techniques called context reframing and content reframing. through context reframing, she gave her time to ask her daughter for ideas about activities and told her when is the inappropriate time for interruption. through content reframing, she let her daughter choose activities to do during her work time.%%",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

One of my clients successfully applied NLP reframing to a situation in her life. It was between Mon and Daughter. Before NLP the situation was the following: Mon worked from home, but daughter interrupted her work, so Mon felt frustrated with her daughter. Mon couldn't concentrate on work, she suffered from lack of sleep and felt guilty and would apologize for her negative behavior. After having used NLP mom and daughter spent time together planning their out activities for the week, daughter got needed attention from mom and felt more independent. As a result mom got more work done and she got more sleep. There are some of the techniques which we used to resolve the conflict. First, we had to identify their negative behaviors, after that we identified positive intentions for mom and daughter. finally it helped us to determine context reframing: daughter had special time for planning their out activities with mom. As for content reframing a special time was provided for mom and daughter to create options for daughter to get positive attention.",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

The overture is the mother being interrupted again and again by her daughter. She had to work from home so she couldn't have her job done in time. She tried to cope with this delay working by night but, ultimately this brought her not to sleep enough time. She was unable to stand her tiredness, always overreacting and very angry with her daughter , and feeling guilty about that behavior. At this point we used the NLP techniques. The mother was helped by our operators to understand the problem: the reasons behind her negative reactions (her excessive anger) and her positive intentions (the need to protect her working time). She entered into her daughter's shoes and understood her daughter's negative reactions (the interruptions during her mother's working time) and positive intentions (to communicate more with her mother because she felt shut out from her). They both settled the problem firstly by spotting a list of things the daughter had to do all the week long (and they put on the wall a written weekly schedule). secondly they talked and agreed on the time they could spend together and the time that had to be left for the mother to work peacefully.",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

Im really concerned about this plan because I think this would have a bad impact on our local shops. Most of them are of small and medium size and cant compete with the pricing structure of a big supermarket. Another point which I would like to stress is the fact that 87 % of your people are against it, as a recently taken survey showed. And, finally, we should not forget to consider about what will happen to our jobs? Will there be enough jobs in future for our younger generation? therefore I want to reiterate my request for you to reconsider permitting super-Mart to set up store in our town.

I understand that many of our fellow citizens are against it. However, I strongly believe this is a development opportunity for our town. opponents to super-Mart believe the pop-and-mom shops will go bust, the traffic will increase and local people will not have any benefit from the opening of this new big store. On the contrary, I am convinced this new mall will boost the local economy and will provide to all consumers a very convenient one-stop shopping at low prices. furthermore, I would also like to emphasize that the fears that local shops are groundless. The shops in the center and the new mall will have different target customers. In the city center high quality goods are sold and the few grocery shops barely cover the needs of those who cannot drive or do not have the car. The super-Mart will instead compete with the others big malls that are in the neighbor towns. Yours sincerely, Giovanni Fontana",You are an English learner.Your native language is not English.

BAWE,BAWE_734,"Explore Shakespeare's handling of the conventions of tragedy in Othello, and the tragedy of Desdemona","At the time of writing Othello, Shakespeare's knowledge of tragedy would have been largely dependent upon ancient Greek drama. This genre of performance was deeply ritualised and frequently based on events in the religious calendar, aimed at the Gods. They believed that tragedy was in their hands and that anyone who transgressed their laws would suffer vengeance as a result. These performances are thought to have presented true humility and a sense of the human character. They portrayed humanity as fallible, and Othello is definitely similar to the Greek tragedies in the sense that all of the characters are liable to make mistakes. This essay will explore the extent to which Shakespeare applied Aristotle's principles of tragedy to Othello, and specifically examine the reasons for Desdemona's tragedy. In the third century BC Aristotle attempted to differentiate between the different genres of writing, and he came up with five main principles of tragedy. The first point stated that ""Tragedy is the representation of an action that is worth serious attention, complete in itself"". By this he meant that it is not dependant on its characters and more focused on the actual plot. The play would always display a unity and wholeness,...","You are a university student.

Firstly, why is it that globally, women continue to shoulder the major burden of domestic and care work in the household, and secondly how can this phenomenon be explained? To answer the questions, the essay will investigate feminist theories on sexual division of labour, drawing specifically on three major feminist theories, the essay will compare research data from various regions of the world on sexual division of labour, to explore the reasons why women continue to shoulder the major burden of domestic and care work. Furthermore, it will discuss women and men's perceptions of fairness of domestic division of labour. The paper draws its conclusion from available data and argues that there have been a slight change in domestic division...",You are a university student.

Moreover, there is a great debate on the implications of globalisation (or internationalization) for the role of nation states. On one hand, some globalists indicated that '...in terms of global economy, nation states have become little more than bit actors' (Ohmae, 2000:207); on the other hand, people supposed that nation states have played and will continue to play a key role in the global economic integration process (Weiss, 1997). In order to critically evaluate Ohmae's statement, this essay will firstly focus on the extent of economic globalisation, how far has economic globalisation gone?

In 'On making sense of Greek religion' John Gould disputes the notion that we can simply 'make sense' of the evidence left- 'data which we put together and call 'Greek religion': the best we can hope for will be no more than piecemeal explanations of a particular ritual or a particular myth' We have only a fragmented picture of ancient Greek religious practices from the evidence of art and descriptive texts. We have an even less precise idea of the reasoning behind Greek rituals- religious belief, as with other aspects of ancient cultures, leaves little physical evidence remaining. We do know that much of Greek religion was secretive and an enigma to the uninitiated even at the time, with widespread secret cults and 'mysteries'. It is also difficult to come to conclusions on 'Greek religion', as the area we now call Greece wasn't a unified country until long after the 5th century BC, rather an area of land on which separate city states co-existed.

BAWE,BAWE_301,What part did the factors outlined in Weber's Protestant Ethic play in explaining the divergent economic development of Western and Eastern civilisations,"Max Weber's Protestant Ethic has been one of the most significant and well publicised disputes of twentieth-century scholarship. The associated literature largely portrays, incorrectly, a monocasual relationship between the development of a Protestant ethic and the emergence of modern capitalism, neglecting the more pluralistic explanation, which Weber himself puts forward. Within the Protestant Ethic, Weber identifies the separation of the business from the household, book- keeping, science, law, education, citizenship, climate, and biology as factors that influenced, and were influenced by, the spirit of capitalism and consequently modern capitalist culture. For Weber, the formation of the Protestant religion in the sixteenth century preceded the emergence of this spirit. Thus, Weber argues, the emergence of modern capitalism was facilitated by the formation of the Protestant religion, for it encouraged attributes that were conducive to its progress. These developments of religion, which were lacking in the East, help then to explain the economic divergence between Western and Eastern civilisations. Implicitly, given the pessimistic tone in which Weber concludes, the Protestant Ethic also unveils the dangers of capitalist development. Labour, rather than a religious calling, can develop simply into an economic function as a means in itself. As a result, it is not...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_282,The Essence of Political Power,"In his 1968 pluralist thesis, Robert Dahl describes politics as the analysis of the nature, exercise and distribution of power; accordingly, a precise understanding of power is vital to all political study. Scholars and philosophers have struggled with the concept of power since Antiquity; debate has focused over whether power can be exercised responsibly, on how it should be distributed, and on whether power can be possessed as an attribute, or rather manifested purely as an activity, in the production of intended results. Theorists further question why people exercise power - while Nietzsche claims that humans possess a fundamental ""will to power"", for Hobbes power struggles are merely fuelled by the scarcity of resources. The complexity of these views suggests that claims that 'politics is power' and that political power exists only within governments are oversimplified. So as to truly gain insight into today's political world, we must carefully reconsider the nature, uses and effects of power. <fnote>Dahl, Robert. Who Governs?

Initially it was content with setting up bases in the West Coast of India for exporting valuable commodities such as spices, calicoes, precious metals and jewels to Europe. Therefore, it sustained a current account deficit in the opening century or its trade with Mughal India. However, by the time the British Crown under Queen Victoria formally replaced it as the official administrators of matters pertaining to India in 1858, it had turned its deficit into a massive surplus. Whereas initially gold and silver bullion flowed into India to account for the expensive luxury commodities being purchased from her, by the turn of the 19 th century India was importing en masse from the product portfolio of the company. Such changes in the fortunes of the East India Company must be attributed primarily to the successful political conquest of the lucrative trading regions of the Indian sub-continent, as the company was able to remove competition and establish a hegemonic presence in these markets.

Lady Macbeth, in Shakespeare's Macbeth, says this to her husband in order to incite him to kill the current king and to take the throne. Overwhelmed by her fierce determination, Macbeth responds to her, 'Bring forth men-children only, for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males.' Probably it is not only Macbeth who feels unspeakable fear at her declaring this, but most of us may agree that it is the last thing a mother can do in any circumstances and for any reasons to kill her own children. This is one of the reasons why Medea, who deliberately murdered her children just to take revenge on her dishonest husband, is often regarded as a person who does not have any consistent characteristics, or even a kind of supernatural monster-like figure.

When it arises that a food is not safe there can be bad consequences such as food poisoning occurring. There are many aspects involved in trying to keep food safe and a lot of opportunities for something to go wrong so it is very important that every detail, in food manufacture and once it reaches the consumer, is payed careful attention to.

In this dialectic the individual life spirit is always in danger of being trapped and suffocated by rules and forms that it has created, forms that now confront and constrain this spirit.

Haimon the son of Kreon was the last and fairest victim of the Sphinx. There is not a comprehensive monograph on the Haimon Painter and the 1936 book by Haspels is still being used as the main textbook. Moreover, there is negative sentiment in the literature about the Haimon Painter. He is being discussed within the context of the degeneration of art and the Haimon Painter is being described productive rather than artistic. Haspels (1936: 131) emphasises that the conception of the decoration on the Haimon Painter vases is vague and there is no unity between the scenes. There are definite problems with the existing literature on the Haimon Painter. Firstly, there are a number of limitations relating to the art-historical approach. The emphasis has been on stylistic distinctiveness because style has been used for chronology. The attribution of vases to this painter has been based on detailed comparisons.

This has prompted Chomsky to famously suggest that babies have an innate 'language acquisition device' (Harley, 2001), but now it seems rather that babies are born with a number of various 'devices', or predispositions and abilities, through which they learn language. Despite the tendency to see babies as passive learners, just absorbing language, babies are actually very active in the process, interacting with the people around them in a way that will help their language development. There are several mechanisms that they have to help them along this path, such as getting attention from adults, innate preferences for useful stimuli, in-built perception skills to help them decode speech, and forming an attachment which helps construct a very beneficial environment for improving language abilities. The first and most important characteristic of babies for their later language development is the indisputable fact that they are very social, that is they are predisposed to seek interaction with other human beings, right from birth. Babies depend entirely on care provision from others, and even when their basic needs of food, warmth and physical comfort are met,...",You are a university student.

The process by which we use our knowledge to make these inferences is known as reasoning. We use reasoning in nearly everything - from solving mathematical conundrums to finding the way to a particular destination. It is of no surprise then, that the mechanisms of reasoning are of such interest to psychologists. Previous research has led some psychologists to conclude that inferences are drawn through the means of parallel, associative links while others argue that reasoning is based on the application of systematic rules. In an effort to make sense of the gap between these two perspectives, yet other researchers propose that there are in fact two co-existing systems of reasoning. Sloman (1996) is one of the proponents of such a dual systems theory. His dichotomy consists of the associative system and the rule-based system.

BAWE,BAWE_86,Account for the failure at Roanoke.,"This essay will attempt to account for the failure of the English colonists to settle on the island of Roanoke on three separate occasions in the 1580s. There are a large number of important reasons for this, many of which were interlinked, but the essay will argue that there were four primary explanations, namely, poor relations with the local Native Americans, the choice of Roanoke island itself as the site at which the English decided to settle, the people who actually emigrated to Roanoke including their aims and motives, and finally the lack of support that the colonists received from their mother country, England. With these circumstances in place, the settlement at Roanoke was all but doomed to fail. When the colonists first arrived at Roanoke, their relations with the local Native American tribe (of southern Algonquian stock) were relatively good. They were given food which helped them to survive. Relations were positive on the first visit in July 1584, which was purely a short term expedition to see whether the land was suitable for settlement - 'Indians were friendly and not too numerous.""

America was seen as a New World, a type of utopia in which the colonists could leave behind the disease ridden cities of Europe and start afresh. There was a tendency to idolize rural ways, and, consequently, pastoralism was advocated as the ideal form of landscape.

Here, we are before something very precise, as indicated by the definite article ""the"", a specific box that will become ""my"" box in the last two stanzas. Moreover, the pre-modifying adjective ""magic"" conveys an idea of supernatural elements, so much so if we associate the expression with that of ""Pandora's Box"".

This acceptance of foreign practices can be seen in the importation of the cult of the Magna Mater, the welcoming of Mithraism, and the assimilation of some native religions into that of the Romans. Yet while some foreign religions were imported into Rome or assimilated into the Roman state religion, others were viewed with complete disdain and hostility. I believe that this was because these foreign religions were often seen as both a political threat, and as having practices that were anti-social and indecent. Together these factors caused many foreign religions to be viewed disapprovingly by the upper echelons of Roman society. To understand why Roman elites accepted some foreign religions, but were extremely hostile to others, it is important to give a brief summary of their religious background, and how they were attached to the...",You are a university student.

In almost all countries across history, has existed the myth of the immigrant. This myth is still prevalent in modern society. Immigrants are feared and discriminated against, because they are markedly different from the indigenous population. Economic recession, crime, and almost any other societal problem can be blamed on those identifiably 'non-local'. This question will broadly examine if this discrimination leads to migrants in Britain being clustered into specific areas, and types of accommodation, and what effect this in turn has on the migrant population. It will focus on structural discrimination, this is not to say this is the only type of discrimination, but it is the most relevant type for this essay. This essay will attempt to objectively define the key concepts of class and ethnicity, and then to question if these are useful definitions and whether any alternative concepts should be uses instead?

It is true to say that both the novel Flugasche and the novella Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum give the reader a large number of examples of the a very negative depiction of the press. The pieces differ, however, as the reasons for these pessimistic representations mirror contradicting social themes of the times the books were written. It is incidentally, somewhat ironic that the very 'ideal' of the press being free is what is, on the one hand the problem in Flugasche where it is censored by the German Democratic Republic state, but in the case of Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum, the presence of this freedom within the Federal German Republic destroys Katharina who is left helpless and without state protection.

BAWE,BAWE_278,The Feminist Contribution to Political Thought: A Ground-Breaking Challenge,"The past centuries have witnessed an ""ongoing struggle between and amongst political ideologies"" as liberals, socialists, conservatives, nationalists and others have proposed rival interpretations of political reality. In spite of their many differences, however, the mainstream approaches have all ignored the political significance of sexual divisions. It is only with the nineteenth-century emergence of the women's movement, and more powerfully with the rise of 'second-wave' feminism the 1960's, that the issue of gender was ""raised . . . as a major challenge to the discipline [of political science]."" By forcing the customarily public scope of politics to embrace the private sphere, by exposing the patriarchal assumptions underlying conventional political theory, and by drawing attention to the fundamental role of gender in shaping all aspects of life, feminism puts the dominant institutions of political thought into serious question. The core feminist themes reveal that the traditional ideologies, and in particular liberalism, provide a highly biased and male-oriented interpretation of reality - they may consequently be ""inadequate vehicles for advancing the social role of women"".

Genes are transferred from one organism to another via modified strains of viruses and bacteria. Some of the reasons given for genetic modification include delayed ripening, decreased allergens, crops that are more resistant to climate extremes or disease, altering the nutrient content of foods and increasing the efficiency of food production systems. A key reason for genetic engineering is to make production cheaper and easier. There are also many negative consequences and risks to take in to account; such as loss of biodiversity, risk to human health, increased power of giant biotech firms, contamination of crops through cross-pollination and the potential for 'super weeds', which would be pest resistant. For these reasons genetic modification is a highly controversial topic. The attitude of individual consumers is influenced by their perceptions of the benefits and risks posed by GM foods, levels of risk aversion, knowledge of science, views about government and corporations as well as their moral and ethical views.

Wordsworth's We Are Seven,"Hugh Blair voices an attack on the practices of 18th century poets in his Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres for the circulation of artificial and lofty pieces among the intellectual classes which detached poetry from the concerns of the everyman. Blair exposes the harmful effect on works that are motivated by money and reputation rather than using the imagination with an aim to educate, inspire, move, delight and communicate with the reader. Wordsworth and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads indicated a revolution in literary history in reaction to the poetry created in the Augustan period, favouring tastefulness, elegance and civility. Wordsworth and Coleridge experiment with a new way of using language in this volume, eradicating features of 18 th century poets by composing organic, liberated and passionate verses inspired by real people and concerning real life experience. We Are Seven offers an excellent example of the power of simple and direct language to relate personal emotion and experience that is successful in accessing a wider readership. Wordsworth emancipates the common man into art by elevating the natural to the supernatural, entirely worthy of his glorification.

However it was fascism which took hold in Italy and anti-liberalism which prevailed as the ideology. Benito Mussolini and others like him played on the people's fears about economic and political stability and attracted supporters from many backgrounds. Nonetheless, despite the speed and strength with which fascism appeared in Italy I am going to argue that this was only possible due to the huge divisions within the left and if the left had come together as a united force then they may well have had their revolution and stopped fascism at its roots. Firstly though, I am going to explore the fascist counter-offensive and evaluate exactly how they were able to overcome both the Socialists and the Liberals.

The emergence of methods such as the Natural Approach, Communicative Language Teaching, and Task-Based Learning, have challenged traditional theories and have prompted language teachers to explore their own attitudes toward successful ways of learning. The controversial issue still facing teachers is the dichotomy between a focus on meaning and a focus on form that essentially determines the application of such theories in the language classroom. This paper will view some of the learner differences relevant to my experiences of teaching adolescents. It will elaborate on the nature of eclectic teaching, through reflection on my personal context. It will then look at the indispensable balance of structure and content-based instruction in the implementation of approaches to language learning. It will finally consider the significance of motivational activities to effective learning.

BAWE,BAWE_480,An Analysis of the Conflict over Water Resources in Central Asia.,"This statement, made by a World Bank Vice President, is evidence of an increasing awareness across the world that water resources have tremendous potential to create interstate problems and conflicts. In Post-Soviet Central Asia, water has proven to be an irreconcilable dilemma. The legacy of Soviet central planning with relation to water has left severe economic, political and ecological tensions in the region, which the five successor states have yet to solve, and yet, there is only limited time to solve this water crisis. Soviet planning in the 1960s had created a fully co-ordinated and centralised water management system. Though this system was, and still is, an ecological catastrophe, nevertheless, it was easy to manage as a single entity. With the collapse of the USSR in 1991, this system must now be managed by five autonomous and competing states, each with varying needs and priorities for their water. With attempts at co-operation so far having little impact, a great deal of tension has built up surrounding the access to water resources.

It was only after the Romans introduced this level of 'civilisation' that these countries truly developed. However, this is not true as any society will have structure and in this case, often well developed. Nevertheless, the imposition of the roman army on foreign ways of life would have had some influence in spheres such as urbanisation, the military, architecture and religion. By looking at some examples of towns and areas of Northern Europe I will analyse the contribution the army made. The strategy of the Roman Empire was generally to conquer by using minimum force. This usually meant that they would go in and take over existing structures, using the elite to control the people. In order to create a feeling of inclusion rather than oppression for the conquered people they would try to remove the army as soon as possible, leaving only what was necessary in the cases of frontier provinces, such as Britain and the Rhineland.

From Columbus' discovery of the New World in 1492, European travellers brought a host of animals, plants and seeds across the Atlantic and many of these were assimilated into the Indian diet. However, the speed and success of such reception varies among the different foodstuffs that colonisers attempted to introduce; whilst meat and vegetables complemented the indigenous diet, attempts to present wheat as a superior staple to maize were far less successful.

BAWE,BAWE_64,Should we be worried about the effects on children of aggressive images on film and television?,"Watching television has become an increasingly popular leisure activity in recent times. It has become especially popular among children with more children's programmes available, and the introduction of entire channels dedicated to them. As well as violent and aggressive images that some children's programmes contain, children are also exposed to adult programmes that are violent and aggressive in nature. As a result of this viewing, there are increasing concerns about how these aggressive images affect children's development and whether they encourage children to be more aggressive. Psychological research provides an attempt to address these concerns. One area of relevant research is the proposition of theories to explain ways that children may learn to be more aggressive through watching aggression in films and on television. One theory about the learning of aggression was proposed by Huesmann (as cited in Josephson, 1987) and was concerned with the formation of social scripts. Social scripts are ways of solving problems and are learnt by observing the behaviour of others. The following of a script is almost automatic and tends to be spontaneous.

As simple as the definition of culinary taste may seem, it has been causing a great deal of controversy over the decades. Some sociologists such as A. Warde (1997), D. Seymour (2003) and specially P. Bourdieu (1984) defend that the construction of taste is a result of our socialisation process, into a determined class and that, regardless of any changes (ex: wealth or occupation), our taste will always remain the same, because it is inherent in us. Others, such as Z. Bauman (1988, 1990), and M.

Spain's weak economical and military situation, the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and the Noticias secretas de America forced the Bourbons to reassess the aims and methods of the Spanish imperial government. This undoubtedly led to the formation of the Bourbon Reforms, which aimed to modernize the Spanish economy, society and institutions.

Sensation is recognised as the immediate and basic experiences which are generated as stimuli fall on our sensory systems, whereas perception refers to the interpretation of these sensations by the brain giving them meaning and organisation (Matlin, 1997). The speed at which a sensation becomes a perception is so great that many people take for granted the way sensations are processed and interpreted by the brain, to the extent that they do not realise any sort of processing is carried out. Questions regarding the information which informs us of what we perceive a sensation to be have been considered for hundreds of years with many different theories being formed. The theories can be divided into two groups: those which outline a top-down process and those which outline bottom-up processing. Top-down processing refers to the way that our brain interprets sensations according to our own knowledge, whereas bottom-up processing involves us understanding the meaning of a sensation purely from the information the stimulus itself provides us with (Gleitman, 2004).

A Critical Examination of Arguments for and Against Unconditional Basic Income.,"The idea of an unconditional basic income (UBI) has been coming to the forefront of political discussion in recent times especially in European countries such as the Netherlands where its merits are being looked at more closely in an attempt to find a solution to unemployment and high levels of poverty. A UBI has been justified in terms of having the means to do what one might want to do, an argument of real freedom put forward predominantly by Philippe Van Parijs, and in terms of justice and equality of opportunity, an argument associated with John Rawls. There have been further advantages proposed but they have tended to be of a more pragmatic nature and it is the principled arguments of Rawls and of distributive justice which I will argue present the strongest reasoning for a UBI. I am going to compare the merits of my argument with those of other supporters and then attempt to defend a UBI against the many objections and alternatives which have been suggested. Van Parijs defines a UBI as being paid by the government to every full member of society (excluding children) even if a person is unwilling to work, irrespective of them being...",You are a university student.

Russell, recognising China's essential differences to the West, asks whether China can retain its 'virtues' without being forced to adopt the 'model' of ""all the foreign nations with which she has dealings"", a question that is just as relevant today. In the last decade, economic importance on the world stage has increased dramatically, to an extent at which even Russell might be surprised. Economic reforms have been implemented rapidly since Deng Xiaoping's exhortation to the people that ""to get rich is glorious"" leading to its powerful current position, where it stands to overtake the US as the world's largest economy by 2020. The extent of China's influence is easy to see, with their fuel needs pushing up oil prices, their cheap goods fuelling consumption and their huge markets for an ever increasing number of goods fuelling demand for foreign manufacturers, the Chinese economy is playing an increasingly large role on the world stage, a fact that has not escaped the notice...",You are a university student.

Introduction</heading>The EU's readiness to eliminate export subsidies by 2014, declared at the 6 th Ministerial WTO conference in Hong Kong at the end of last year, released torrents of speculations on its impact on the future shape of the Common Agricultural Policy. However, as the details on modalities are yet to be agreed and the only piece of information available is 'the date', the accuracy of conjectures may be limited just like the scope of the following analysis. It focuses solely on the potential impact of export subsidy abolition on the European dairy policy - the last bastion of the old-style CAP. By this example it argues, that the progressing WTO negotiations do and will have a measurable effect on the evolution of the agricultural policy of the European Union. The essay is organised as follows: section 2 presents shortly the nature of export subsidies as an inherent aspect of the CAP, then section 3 follows with a brief overview of the history of the WTO negotiations that have step-by-step led to the current explicit declarations of export refund abolition.

BAWE,BAWE_789,"Why do individuals disperse from their natal groups? Describe different dispersal strategies. What are the genetic consequences of dispersal for the individual, the social group, species population structure and conservation?..(""","<heading>Introduction</heading>Natal dispersal, or the movement of organisms away from a place of birth, occurs among a range of species (Brookeral. 1999). Dispersal to a new group may be temporary, or a permanent transfer (Pusy & Packer, 1987). Individuals often go to extreme lengths to migrate from their natal group, e.g. Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) have been seen travelling 60 kilometres to reach new breeding groups (Pusey & Packer, 1987). Long distance dispersal of this nature may be costly both energetically and through the increased risk of predation and potential aggression from strangers (e.g. vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops): Cheney & Seyfarth, 1983; olive baboons (Papio anubis): Packer & Pusey, 1979). Dispersal often incurs locational costs as individuals leave behind a familiar home range (Isbell & van Vuren, 1996), e.g. individuals from a group of red howler monkeys (Aloatta seniculus) suffered protein and phosphorous deficiency due to a poor diet as a result of reduced foraging efficiency in unfamiliar forests following dispersal (Pope, 1989). Primates are predominantly social mammals spending a high proportion of time making fervent bonds and securing relationships with group members (de Waal, 1988). Therefore, the social costs of leaving a familiar family group may also be high. Despite...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_81,What factors account for the failure of the Church Missionary Society's Wellington Valley Mission?,"The reasons for the failure of the Church Missionary Society's Wellington Valley Mission are tremendously extensive and can broadly be divided into two categories. Some were common to the missionary attempts occurring all over the continent. These included the use of the mission by the Aborigines for purposes other than religion; Protestant missionaries' reluctance to pronounce an Aborigine as 'converted'; the decline in the Aboriginal population due to disease, inter-tribal warfare and the driving out of Aborigines by European settlers; the negative influence of the convicts on the Aborigines and finally the vast difference in Aboriginal and European belief systems. Others, however, were more specific to the Wellington Valley Mission such as a lack of funding, poor farming conditions, tensions between senior missionaries and the loss of the Agriculturist, William Porter. The essay will account for and analyse these separate reasons and come to the conclusion that the vast difference in belief systems was undoubtedly the primary cause for the failure of the mission. One of the principal factors in explaining the failure of the mission was the fact that the Aborigines, and indeed the surrounding white population, used the missions for purposes other than religion.

BAWE,BAWE_297,'Patriarchy was more secure on paper than in practice.' Discuss.,"The position of women in the period of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has long been described as one of subordination. Patriarchy, a system that places the authority of men over that of women in both, the public sphere of society, and the private sphere of the household, was evident in both law and custom. Women were excluded from government offices, barred from educational establishments and excluded from most professions and trades. Within the household, husbands had authority over all members and also had control over women's moveable property. Despite then the position of women appearing seemingly the manifestation of this patriarchal authority, social realities were less extreme then law and tradition would suggest. Within business, women could conduct trade under legal fiction and were able to find employment where guilds did not operate. In the household, parenting was conducted as a joint responsibility and many poor families also relied upon a wife's earnings to supplement the husbands. The extent, however, to which patriarchy was seriously challenged, remains slight. Although it was perhaps more secure on paper than in practice, by no means were women's positions equal or comparable to those of men.

My endeavour to find a succinct and useful definition of modality for the purposes of this essay, proved entirely fruitless. The many authoritative sources I consulted provided the following: ""Modality: A term used in grammatical and semantic analysis to refer to contrasts in mood signalled by the verb and associated categories"", Crystal (2003:295); ""Modality is concerned with the status of the proposition that describes the event"", Palmer (2001:1); ""Modality is the category by which speakers express attitudes towards the event contained in the proposition"", Downing and Locke (2001:381). The fact that these definitions fall short of a clear yet descriptive explanation reflect the fact that the rich texture of semantic nuances modality represents cannot be distinguished on the basis of pure grammatical form. On the contrary, the same modal expressions are employed in English to convey a vast complexity of different and even contradictory meanings, e.g., necessity, possibility, certainty, obligation, permission, willingness, ability.

BAWE,BAWE_242,How did silver mining influence the development of the Mexican economy during the sixteenth century?,"Following the conquest of the Aztec empire, the Spanish conquistadors sought to locate and extract precious metal resources that would greatly enhance their personal fortunes. The discovery and acquisition of deposits of gold and silver constituted a fundamental aim of the Crown and its conquering subjects, owing to the continually high demand for such commodities in Europe. In the initial post-conquest period of roughly twenty years, the Spanish concerned themselves with quick returns through the seizure indigenous goods and through the use of primitive extracting techniques. After the discovery of more substantial silver ore deposits in regions such as Zacatecas in 1546 however, mining came to occupy a central position in the colonial economy. Repeated discoveries of important sites and the development of production technology meant that a trend towards increasingly larger annual outputs established itself in the sixteenth century. Owing to the significant demand in the Old World, the bulk of the commodity was exported to Europe, enabling many of the industry's proprietors to achieve substantial wealth and greatly stimulating the growth of the internal economy.

Almost half of today's two hundred and fifty primate species are thought to be of conservation concern in all of the ninety-two countries in which they occur (Rowe, 1996). Even more alarmingly, one in five primate species are classified as being endangered or critically endangered by the Primate Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN), suggesting their viable extinction within the next two hundred years (CITES, 2002). The threat facing primate populations is not evenly distributed. Results show a strong positive correlation across the continents, between extinction risk and human population growth (Wright and Jernvall, 1998), (see Appendix, figure 1). It has been found that those primates most at risk of extinction live in regions where human figures exceed 0.28 humans per hectare (Wright and Jernvall, 1998). While disease, predation and famine influence species densities the impact of human activities are so profound that they appear to over ride all other factors.

However, weight control can be an uphill struggle, not only to lose weight, but then also to maintain it. It is proposed that our genes may give us a predisposition to store fat reserves, as evolution has led us to have a natural drive to eat as much as possible when food is available. However, in today's society, where food is so plentiful, it is easy to over consume. There are many biological factors that contribute to weight regulation; homeostasis, certain brain structures, neurochemicals and metabolism have all been found to influence our weight. However, despite our genetic predispositions, it may be possible to overcome these biological factors through willpower. To understand weight loss, it is necessary to know how the body maintains weight. The regulatory systems that keep body weight constant are very efficient. This is the reason why weight loss can be very difficult and only those with exceptional willpower may be successful. The amount of body fat carried is regulated by homeostasis, which ensures that the internal state is kept within a critical range to avoid disruption...","You are a university student.

It will examine whether the insurrection was a coup d'état conducted by a small and purely self-interested faction, acting entirely for their own benefit - the view subscribed to by many western liberal historians, or whether the successful insurrection was due to the mass support of the Russian people for the Bolshevik party, which was merely realizing their demands - a rigidly enforced Socialist interpretation which all Soviet authors were forced to portray. The final interpretation and the one that this essay will subscribe to is that the Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917 because they had the support of an important minority in Russian society, namely the workers and soldiers, and that the peasants also saw them as the best potential provider of their wishes at the time, especially regarding the re-distribution of the land. Therefore, there was no real opposition to the Bolshevik coup but it would be wrong to describe them as having popular support.

Moral Objectivism, on the other hand, would hold that there is just one moral code, or one moral truth, one morality that is correct.

Whatever the cause, the music industry is clearly redefining itself. An analysis of the current situation divides its future along two possible extremes: on the one hand, if recording companies continue to resist the internet's technological advances through mergers and court cases, today's oligopolistic industry may tend towards a monopoly; alternatively, if the companies undergo the technological change exemplified by file-sharing agencies, costs throughout the music industry will fall and the market may become more competitive.

It is important to acknowledge that this type of migration is completely voluntary and legal.

The fall of infectious diseases, such as TB and cholera, together with an increased life expectancy for men and women, has meant that the proportion of the population surviving into middle and later life has increased, with some sixteen per cent of the population now over the retirement age (Bury, 1997). Associated with this demographic change has been the rise of degenerative health disorders amongst the ageing population. Conditions such as arthritis, stroke and Parkinson's disease, all major sources of disability, have now thoroughly displaced infectious diseases, and made chronic illness an anticipated, if not expected, aspect of the life course in modern societies (Williams, 2003).

Others may come from tropical rainforest areas so need humid warm environments to live in. As these animals are ectothermic, their thermoregulation is done through their behaviour. In order to do this they not only need warm terrariums, but also need a thermal gradient throughout so that they may cool down or warm up as they need. Reptiles also have varied and often specific diets, and finding their natural foods in captivity may prove difficult. These complex needs must be met in captivity or health problems will arise.

Considering the political and militaristic dominance of Athens in Greek history it is not surprising that the majority of Greek mythological evidence that we have today originated from the very same place. Before we begin to discuss the application of the gender stereotypes in relation to various examples of Greek mythology I believe it would be intelligent to define what we mean by stereotypes and to examine the specific way in which the sexes were seen in ancient society. It should be stressed that a stereotype is not a fact; it is not what something is but what a majority perceives it to be or what a majority believes it should be.

The question raised was the precise amount of tax to be paid for the benefit received. The Court of Appeal held the cost for the employer, i.e., school was the average cost and gave a ruling in favour of the school; and the House of Lords reversed the opinion deciding in favour of the taxpayers i.e., the cost of benefit was the marginal cost; and for doing this it relied on parliamentary debates, or Hansard. The ratio laid down in the case was reference to Hansard would be permitted only under the following circumstances: where there is an ambiguity or obscurity as to the meaning of the legislation or when the literal meaning leads to absurdity; and the statement is the statement of a minister or other promoter of the bill; and the statement relied is clear. <fnote>Pepper v Hart [1993] AC 593 @ 640 </fnote>The importance of the case lies in that, the court had to decide if they could have recourse to Hansard in deciding a case, and if did, would it infringe Art....",You are a university student.

As the number of these companies grew, prices went down and flying became a cheap and easy way of travel. But nowadays, no-one can say they have never heard about global warming, which has affected it. Advertising campaigns spur us on to switch off the lights, not to leave the appliances on standby or to avoid taking our cars. However, really few of these campaigns regard flying pollution as a major contributor. Nevertheless, the three articles provide us with frightening information about the effects of flying on the environment. Given the boom in the number of low-cost companies and the multiplication of the numbers of flights, flying has become a source of worry.

However, it would be ignorant for a mature mind not to look at the importance of the characters: What was their role? Were they symbolic? Did they make up part of a larger motif? These are just a few of the questions that could be focused toward characters within myth; questions which, in this essay, I will ask of those hybrid creatures that feature in ancient myth. Hybrid creatures were the predominant antagonist in many hero myths that date back to classical antiquity. It is interesting that 'in the neatly ordered Greek universe, which has reserved distinct compartments for the 'bestial', 'human' and 'divine'' there is no such compartment for those hybrid characters in myth. Even the word 'monster' is a vague description: The idea of 'the Monster is ubiquitous' and as such it remains unclassifiable, something which Lada-Richards argues is due to 'monsters' being 'culture-specific products.'

Assess this statement with reference to at least one play.","Classical Greek theatre played an essential role in the cultural life of democratic Athens. The drama at the annual festival of Dionysus was much more than just a piece of competitive performance theatre, it was one of the few institutions in a polis that intertwined religion, democracy and empire, creating a cultural spectacle that everyone was encouraged to attend. Amongst the sacrifices, parades, tributes and decrees, the plays of famous tragedians such as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were witnessed and admired by almost a whole community, becoming 'the great democratic art form'1. This made theatre an ideal platform to spread messages about Greek culture (defined by factors such as politics, society, war, role of women etc) through the citizens of the polis. Although conclusive evidence from the period is severely limited, it is clear from surviving scripts that the plays themselves were mostly based on Greek mythological stories. This should not be seen as restrictive, as 'despite the heroic plots and characters the situations enacted in the plays were related to the contemporary issues of Athens in the fifth century'2. The skills of the playwrights lay not only in keeping these myths original and fascinating for Athenians, but in using...","You are a university student.

Each of the three stanzas is of equal length and metre, the first five lines of each stanza working in iambic tetrameter followed by the final line of iambic pentameter, reverting to the traditional metre in Shakespeare's love sonnets. Perhaps this steady lyrical rhythm represents the steady heartbeat of the speaker emphasised by the masculine single rhyme scheme, thus linking to the theme of love presented throughout the poem. Supporting this idea is that as the poem draws to a climax in the third stanza, the natural flow of the final lines are broken up by punctuation more often than elsewhere in the 'song' and an exclamation of 'But which, O Cupid, wilt thou take?' possibly conveying the increasing intensity of feelings of the speaker and confusion in her heart, showing how deeply the situation affects her. <fnote>M.

BAWE,BAWE_808,Partnerships in Practice: Responding to Others in Health and Social Care,"There are various social relationships in health and social care. Partnerships are just one of these relationships. It is necessary to be aware that there are different definitions of partnership (Bury, 2004). I will define partnership as a shared understanding and control over a situation; where there are two people involved whose roles are of equal importance. Partnerships between health care professionals enable the sharing of knowledge, ways of working, strengths, skills and resources (Reynolds, 2005). Partnerships benefit patients as treatment becomes based on the most beneficial specialism (Thompson, 1986). Partnerships between colleagues enable communication and practice to be cooperative, respectful and productive. Other partnerships involve the patient or client and their family. In order that the relationship between the health care professional and the client is a partnership it needs to be based on client centred practice (Reynolds, 2005). Traditionally relationships between clients and professionals have been based on high doctor power and control and low patient power and control (Parsons, 1951). This type of relationship depends on distinct and unequal roles of the health care professional and the client (Iphofen and Poland, 1998).

These were the remarks of the late, former Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam when she left office in June 2001. Her assessment reflects increasing debate within British politics regarding the style of Britain's current Prime Minister and the apparent phenomenon of 'creeping presidentialism'. An analysis of the validity of such concerns requires definition of the concepts of 'Prime Ministerial' and 'Cabinet' government whilst this apparent trend must not be considered a product of Blair's premiership alone. Much evidence of a growth in Prime Ministerial power at the expense of Cabinet government can be drawn from the Thatcher era. In addition there remain examples of when Cabinet government has flexed its political muscles and limited the executive strength of the Prime Minister. Some commentators have argued that the recent public Cabinet furore over a ban on smoking and education reforms illustrates the vibrant health of Cabinet government. It seems that the predominance of either Prime Ministerial or Cabinet government depends largely upon the context in which the government must operate e.g. the size of its parliamentary majority.

But what if a feature of the mind that is being called into question by scientific findings is so integral and intuitively certain to us that we feel disinclined to abandon it even in the face of contradictory experimental data? Thomas Nagel (1971) argues that in such an event we must consider whether we have in fact encountered evidence that the mind is not reducible to the brain. An example will help clarify the argument: imagine that it is discovered that once every year each human nervous system on the planet temporarily shuts down, leaving the brain completely void of activity, only to return to an active state some thirty seconds later. Such a discovery would come as a blessing to philosophers of a holistic disposition who fight what they consider unwarranted forms of reductionism in philosophy of mind, because here would be direct proof that the mind is irreducible...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_1127,Do male and female poets use the dramatic monologue form to different effect?,"E. Warwick Slinn describes dramatic monologue as 'the flagship genre of Victorian poetry', which provided 'a medium for multiple forms of cultural critique'. In Victorian England, the capacity of this form to highlight social and political problems was facilitated by both male and female poets, including Augusta Webster, Christina Rossetti and Robert Browning among others. These writers used their poetry to display concern for the dominance of men over women in the workforce and the home, as well as to discuss the injustice of class divisions. The dramatic monologue is a particularly effective method of cultural critique because it firmly detaches the poet from the narrator of a poem. This allows the poet to speak authentically through the voice of the oppressed or oppressor who is personally affected or affects these cultural problems. Bonnie J. Robinson reminds us that Victorian poets were often 'liberal thinkers and activists as well as writers', who wrote with an aim to promote cultural awareness and remove injustices from society. For example, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point was published in the Boston anti-slavery annual in 1848, contributing to the American and British abolition debate in offence of slavery (Slinn, ""Dramatic Monologue"",...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_167,How relevant is Marx's labour theory of value in analysing the nature of employment under contemporary capitalism?,"The concepts underpinning Marx's labour theory of value and the theory itself continue to stimulate discussion. According to Mohun (1994) the theory is 'one of the most debated...in the history of economics'. The sustained debate is an indication, initially, that the theory has a degree of relevance under contemporary capitalism as authors struggle to modify, refine and reinterpret the theory to meet contemporary economic and employment conditions. The focus of this essay is to assess the extent of the labour theory if value's relevance in an analysis of the nature of employment under contemporary capitalism, whilst discussing in detail important aspects and interpretations of Marx's economic theory. In the labour theory of value Marx examines the foundations of employment and the nature of production and the employment relationship are placed at the centre of his analysis. This approach deviates from neo-classical analysis which places the process and inputs of production, including labour, in a 'black box' (Green 1988). Although, some authors have suggested that with the subsequent sophistication of neo-classical theory, 'Marxist critique (of neo-classical labour market analysis) is now misplaced' (Green 1988), others, for example Young (1992), indicate 'similarities' are 'limited' and that 'the reluctance by radical economists to...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_462,Discuss the Reliability and Validity of Qualitative Research Methods,"Two important points to consider when conducting any form of psychological investigation are whether the research is reliable and whether it is valid. Reliability is concerned with how similar the results are to the actual phenomena they are trying to measure. This can be explained by how likely it is that the researcher will obtain the same results if they were to repeat their research again in a different context (Peräkylä, 1997). Validity is concerned with whether the interpretations and conclusions drawn from the research are appropriate considering the type of investigation used (Maracek, 2003). Questions of reliability and validity often arise when conducting research using qualitative methods. Examples of qualitative methods are participant observation, open-ended interviewing and case studies (Maracek, 2003). These ways of approaching research are defined as qualitative because they do not measure behaviour in a numerical way using a strict scientific procedure as in quantitative research. Because qualitative research does not reflect traditional scientific method, it is often stated that qualitative research cannot be reliable or valid. However, many arguments have contradicted this view.

These cells contain a genetic code, unique to each individual, which tells the cell what it should be. In essence, this code, or ""DNA"", is the biological description of what each creature is, from human hair and eye colour, right down to the shape of bacteria. Selective breeding, the process of selecting and encouraging desirable traits in a subject population, has been used by humankind for hundreds of years.

The food processing industry is continually changing as a result of technological advances and consumer pressures. In industrialised countries consumers no longer require the majority of foods to have a shelf life of several months at ambient temperature, such as that offered by canning and pickling. Changes in family lifestyle, and increased ownership of freezers and microwave ovens are reflected in the demands for foods that are convenient to prepare, and are suitable for frozen or chilled storage. Consumers are now increasingly demanding foods with a healthy or natural image, those containing fewer synthetic additives, or which have undergone fewer changes during processing, and resemble the original raw materials. This is also reflected by the growth in demand for organic foods. Manufacturers have responded by reducing or eliminating synthetic additives from products, substituting them with nature or nature identical alternatives.

Ostensibly worlds apart, many thematic similarities emerge between the texts, leading us to question how and what we define contemporary. Religion, gender and identity have remained prominent concerns across the ages and each author is unique in their depiction of how these issues impact on their contemporary society. But, the limitations of language often force the writers to resort to increasingly innovative strategies of rendering these concerns. Religious ambivalence permeates both texts. In Movern Callar, capitalizing 'He' has religious associations if 'He' is seen to represent God. Stealing 'His' identity allows Movern to become her own God; free to lead an existential life as one self-governed and judged by herself alone.

Among these were many workers both skilled and unskilled who were unable to support their families and heavily reliant on the state for support. Working-class pressure in this context mainly constitutes Trade Union groups and Left-leaning political parties that claim to represent working-class interests. Nonetheless, as Salter (Salter and Stevenson 1990) argues there is a distinction between the attitudes and behaviour of working-class members and the organisations that purport to represent them. Moreover, working-class expression is more than just the Trade Unions or Social Democratic parties; it also involves lower-class women, the unemployed, non-union workers and the conservative and liberal working classes. However, due to time constraints this essay will mainly focus on Trade-Unions and Social Democratic party activism as the major sources of working-class political expression.

There are several uses of 'meaning.' There is meaning as intention, e.g., 'I didn't mean to hurt you,' meaning as importance, e.g., 'You mean a lot to me.' There is also a difference between linguistic meaning and speaker meaning. Linguistic meaning is what the language means itself. For example, the French sentence 'Il pleut,' means 'it is raining.' Speaker meaning is what the speaker intends to mean. So if John says, 'Il pleut,' he means 'it is raining.' Frege was particularly interested in the theory of mediated reference. The reference in a sentence is the thing or person and the sense is the meaning or what the object is presented as. <quote> . . .the meaning of an expression is completely determined by the meaning of the parts, plus the way those parts are ordered.</quote><fnote>Stainton, R.J (1996) Philosophical...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_1103,Does Lucan's Civil War have a place for heroism and the heroic?,"In epic, the concept of heroism and heroes has been passed down the tradition for centuries. It has been transformed from Greek heritage with Homer, which then becomes Roman heritage with Virgil, Ovid and eventually Lucan. The changes in the nature of heroism and heroic figures have been substantial. Homeric epic is based around an idea of a 'shame culture', in which heroes were men who did great deeds of valour, by killing other great heroes, the greater the better, in battle and duel, as is shown in the 'Iliad'. This meant that, if a hero did a great deed, then, according to the 'heroic code', the hero would win 'timē' or respect from other heroes, and this was how heroes were judged; on results, rather than on lineage. By Roman times, however, heroic nature had changed with Virgil's 'Aeneid', and the figure of Aeneas as a more dutiful, or 'pius' figure, as he embodies all the values of a Roman, especially that of 'pietas', which is absent in many Homeric heroes. Also, there was less emphasis on the idea of a hero being judged because of deeds on the battlefield as, while this idea still existed, it was overshadowed...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_601,Examine the function of magic in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'One Hundred Years of Solitude',"The unique style of story-telling established by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in his masterpiece 'One Hundred Years of Solitude,' allows him to deliver to the reader a fantastic, unnatural and truly magical experience, as his abandonment of linear form and incorporation of non-rational elements combine to create the supernatural wonderland that is Macondo. The deadpan narration throughout the novel is a key construct when forming and using the literary technique known as ""magical realism,"" and Marquez uses this style to great effect throughout the novel, to such an extent that the unbelievable become commonplace, at times without argument or bewilderment. It is necessary therefore, to establish which 'magical' events in the novel are created to stupefy and intrigue the reader, purely for literary enjoyment, and which are actual metaphors or messages that are formed to symbolise events, encounters or emotions. By placing examples of the many magical and supernatural events into three groups, namely psychological, character, and nature based, it will be possible to review Marquez' ""magical realism"" and consider its function in context with events throughout the novel. The most apparent psychological occurrence in the novel surrounds the idea of an 'insomnia plague,' a so-called 'illness' that 'invaded the town.'(47)...",You are a university student.

Discuss both general issues affecting Europe as whole and specific issues affecting any one particular country.","Beginning in the 1950s, industrialized countries of the world experienced over 20 years of sustained economic growth. Economic growth can be defined as an increase in the productive capacity of a country to produce more output over a period of time. This period is undoubtedly the ""golden age of growth"" because from 1950 to 1973 real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita growth was the highest at 3.7%. In this essay we will look at three main factors which brought about the ""Golden Age"" of economic growth in Europe. We will first examine how Investment facilitated the catching up process which brought about economic growth. Next we would analyze the role of social capital (labour) in generating growth. Lastly, we will observe how trade contributed to this growth.

BAWE,BAWE_28,Discuss the Merits and Demerits of a Strictly Behavioural Approach to the Treatment of Psychological Disorders,"The idea of behaviourism has been around for a long time but was made famous by the work of Ivan Pavlov. He conditioned the behaviour of dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by repeatedly associating the ring of a bell with presentation of food. B. F. Skinner extended this idea whilst working with pigeons to show that animals could be trained to perform various acts in order to get food, as long as the association was made between food and the desired response. Skinner always recommended positive reinforcement such as rewards over negative reinforcement or punishment, (Eysenck, 2002). Such ideas have gradually leaked into the classroom, to increase desired behaviour from children, and even into the National Health Service, to attempt to 'cure' psychological disorders. One major criticism of the behaviouristic approach addresses the claim that behaviour can be explained without reference to mental activity. Human beings have a sense of feeling and of free will; behaviourism disregards this and sees the personality as a set of outward reactions rather than a distinct entity. This means that psychological disorders are not examined for their cause or brain dysfunction but simply observed. As a treatment in the practice...",You are a university student.

The question is whether one can envisage a right to religion without being gender discriminatory, given the history of most religions being patriarchal and opposed to women's rights and freedoms. Certain case studies from India are used to highlight the extremely polarised positions of religious ideologues and feminists that arise in relation to women's rights. The international human rights law has often neglected issues of discrimination and violence against women in the garb of distinction between public and private sphere being applicable only to abuses committed in the public sphere by the State actors while completely ignoring the domestic arena of family that normally witnessed gross forms of human rights violations against women.

BAWE,BAWE_1062,To what extent do readers rely upon information from decoding the written text and to what extent do they bring in information from external sources?,"<heading>Introduction:</heading>The teaching of reading involve two main routes, the lexical route and the sub-lexical route. The lexical route involves a teaching of words as a whole. Goodman (1996: 91) who supported the whole-word theory of reading suggested that 'an efficient reader uses only enough information from the published text to be effective'. This has been disputed by many who place more emphasis on the 'graphophonic system' (Gough and Wren, 1999:67) and the individual role of letters and words rather than whole texts. Adams (1990:105) suggests 'the single immutable fact about skilful reading is that it involves relatively complete processing of the individual letters in print'. This theory places more emphasis on the sub-lexical route whereby decoding via grapheme-phoneme correspondence is vital. Goodman's (1967) most significant claim was that reading was a 'guessing game'. His theory suggested that skilled readers use context to anticipate the words in a text therefore do not need to decode every word. Contrary to this theory is the more recent idea that a skilled reader is someone who can decode automatically without being conscious of it (Field: 2003). This theory also suggests that 'less skilled readers rely heavily on context' (Perfetti 1999:43) as a substitute for...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_1009,How far did Carthage's aim in the First and Second Punic Wars differ?,"Carthage's aims during the First and Second Punic Wars differed greatly. During the First Punic War, Carthage attempted to gain power in Sicily, thereby creating opportunities for further expansion in Italy. Unlike the First, the Second Punic war was an effort by the Carthaginians to revenge the actions of the Romans in the First War, and the central aim of the war was to crush Rome. The First War was led by a large number of generals, many of whom, according to Polybius, were incompetent, whereas the Second War was driven by the personal ambition and objectives of Hannibal. It is difficult to find the true aims of Carthage during the war, since no Carthaginian primary sources survive, and the two main sources are Polybius and Livy. This essay will investigate the aims of Carthage during the First and Second Punic Wars, using Polybius and Livy, as well as various secondary sources, and will investigate the personal aims of Hannibal and the reasons for the survival of the Roman Republic during the war.

It attempts to answer whether the outcome can be explained by use of the median voter theorem and concludes that this is the case in as far as the predictions that result from implementing the theorem are as vague as the variables that it considers. The General Election of 2005 was, in comparison to those of 1979 and 1997, a fairly lacklustre one and in this respect, the median voter theorem fairs well when analysing it. The economic theories devised in Adam Smith's magnum opus The Wealth of Nations gave rise to the political paradigm of rational choice. The concept of self-interested individuals persuing maximum utility, and thus resulting in collective welfare, was one that could be applied to politics as effectively as Smith applied it to economics.

BAWE,BAWE_432,Discuss the ways in which the category 'middle class' emerged in significance in the period 1780 - 1840.,"As Wahrman has pointed out in Imagining the Middle Class, it is impossible to construct ""the making"" of the 'middle class' in the same way that one can the working class. There is no single event or time when this category emerged in either political or social life, instead an evolutionary process whereby 'middle class' over and above other terms came to represent a particular section of society and, in turn, a set of values. It is tempting to demarcate the Industrial Revolution as the point at which this conversion occurred due to the socially transforming effect it brought upon England in initiating the move from a domestic economy to one based upon the factory system. This system, one could perhaps argue, led to the increased individualisation of society whereby exploitation meant that looking out for one's own interests came to be of paramount importance. In turn, this ""egoism of individuals leads to an egoism of the class they form"" in that those who find they are in the same position group together to form a 'class' and fight collectively for their particular interests.

What impact can monetary and fiscal policy have in these models?","Aggregate supply (AS) measures the quantity of goods and services produced within the economy at a given overall price level. It is determined by the supply side performance of the economy and reflects not only the overall productivity of the economy, but also the cost of production is each sector. Shapes of the AS curve are very different in Classical, Keynesian and New Keynesian models as a result of various assumptions and restrictions in each model. The Classical model assumes that the AS curve is strictly vertical. The level of output depends on factors of production, i.e. capital, machines and physical work supplied by labour during the production of output. The only way to increase output is to increase the levels of capital and labour. For instance, firms could employ more workers or increase their investment to raise the capital stock. Therefore, AS can only be affected by the levels of capital and labour and is perfectly inelastic to the price level. In the labour market workers face the choice between leisure and the real wage.

Thus sixteenth-century religion had a widespread affect on people's lives that cannot be underestimated. However, a pessimistic tone has often prevailed in the historiography of early modern religion from historians of the traditional school of thought, for instance Johan Huizinga and A. G. Dickens. They believe that the era was marked by a decline in the late medieval Church, in comparison to the flourishing religion of the high Middle Ages, which evoked widespread discontent. This outlook implies that religion did not have a resounding affect on people's lives, and when it did it was predominantly negative and may have resulted in people abandoning or reforming their faith. On the other hand, revisionist historians, such as Eamon Duffy and Christopher Haigh in their studies of England and A. J. Bijsterveld who has examined religion on the continent, have adopted a more optimistic approach.

Plato is performing a fallacy of equivocation with this unjustified assumption that justice in the state and justice in the soul are analogous. The reason(s) for Plato's analogy between the State and the Soul are problematic, poorly argued with little depth and in fact prove to be false. The analogy is not only an inaccurate picture, but when examined in detail, lacks internal consistency with regard to the parts of the soul. This essay will examine Plato's conception of justice, the analogy of State and Soul, the reasons given for assuming such a similarity exists and will argue that the venture is in fact misguided. Firstly, some terms and assumptions must be addressed. Plato's theory of justice is agent centred rather than act centred and has drawn criticism as any act performed by a 'just' agent will be deemed 'just' (Pappas, 1995).

BAWE,BAWE_461,Are there two systems of reasoning? Make reference to Sloman and Stanovich &amp; West.,"The nature of human reasoning is a popular area of research in psychology. Its popularity has derived from questions about the rationality of human thought. Rational thought is sometimes defined as thought which is analogous to the laws of logic, where there is always a correct or incorrect answer to a problem and a finite approach to solving it (Eysenck & Keane, 2000). Many psychologists would disagree with this definition because they believe that reasoning does not have to be logical to be rational (Sloman, 1996, Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996 and Chater, Oaksford, Nakisa & Redington, 2003). Sloman (1996) focused, in depth, on the debate over rationality in human reasoning, and created a model involving two systems of reasoning to explain the variety of results found in experiments that investigated reasoning. The two systems of reasoning proposed by Sloman (1996) are an associative system and a rule-based system.

The number of unemployed rose from 1.3 million in 1979 to 3 million in 1982 (Jones and Novak, 1999, p39, Glynn, 1999, p190), and as Burnett notes these figures remained high throughout the 1980s and 1990s (1994).

Motherhood has been used as the yardstick to measure all other women to. Motherhood is thus seen as the ultimate destiny for women and as a goal to which all heterosexual women in a stable relationship aspire. The counter argument illustrates how motherhood may be considered as a woman's source of subordination as not only are women disadvantaged in the public sphere, but also undervalued in the private household structure. Chodorow provides an important starting point to the discussion of motherhood. In 1978, 'The Reproduction of Mothering: Psychoanalysis and the sociology of Gender' was published. Chodorow analyses how mothering is replicated through generations of the family. To the female child, the mother is the object of personal identification that sets a role model. The desire to mother is not just part of a natural inheritance, but the skills that are needed are acquired throughout growing up. This leads children to replicate the sexual and familial division of labour (Chodorow, 1999, p7).

There is scope to talk about island societies rather than islands because an island is not always a social unit. Besides, by examining a number of islands in the Neolithic we can address the very nature of Neolithic societies and contrast with the village-settlements in Thessaly and the salience of agriculture on land that was frequently flooded. We can agree with Broodbank that the seas united rather than divided Neolithic communities in the Cyclades. Firstly, the extreme barren environments of the Cycladic islands created an imperative for external links and contacts. Secondly, one would expect from ethnography a nexus of contacts between islands as part of survival strategies (exchange and exogamy). Thirdly, the archaeological similarities in material culture between different islands appear to reflect the social ties between islands communities.

(Tim Ingold 1999: ix)</quote>This witty comment of Tim Ingold brilliantly introduces to the main problem, which I will discuss in this piece of work. Archaeology is undoubtedly an important discipline which gives us a 'visual' insight into the history of ancient societies. However, its very nature, being based merely on perishable material remains, causes a serious interpretative dilemma and a relatively narrow perspective, focusing mainly on material culture. Here anthropology comes to aid, filling the gap between the data and their significance for the structures of ancient societies. The relation between these two disciplines is perceived differently in Britain and in America, which needs to be taken into account, since this can affect the perception of some scholars, depending on their academic background. In America archaeology is but a counterpart of anthropology, broadly understood as the study of human activity, in which material culture (the focus of archaeology) is inevitably incorporated as a product of human activity. In Britain on the other hand, these two disciplines evolved separately, the main distinction between them being in terms of data they use for their analysis.

Factors such as free will and the creativity of engineers will also be explored. The engineering codes are what govern and promote morality amongst the engineering industry. These codes are aimed to deal with the issues that engineers must confront on a daily basis. Due to the sensitivity and risk contained in their work, great concern must be taken to follow these codes, but to what extent? The statement focuses on engineers having a lack of autonomy within their work. This is controversial, as it promotes a lack of distinction between the creativity that engineers possess. In some opinions, it is vital for engineers to exhibit this creative freedom. ""Loss of autonomy is a clear indicator that a fundamental fracture has occurred in the professional-client relationship.""1 This supporting view displays the further idea that engineers need to be able to behave autonomously if they are to prevail within their careers, and hence their organisations. It is the autonomous view which gives engineers differentiation, and allows personal ethics to be exhibited.

He has influenced our understanding of sexuality within varying topics, but due to restraints only his understanding of sexuality contained within The History of Sexuality, Volume One, The Will to knowledge (1976), and his influence within the fields of sexology and homosexuality will be looked at. One contribution is his rejection of what he termed the 'repressive hypothesis' by showing that although empirically, sex was silenced, this was merely words and that Victorian sexuality was actually central to society, being discussed through various sexual discourses (for example science and medicine). Moreover, Foucault has also aided our understanding of power (and its relation to sexual discourses) by challenging conventional notions and showing it to be both a positive and a negative force (allowing for the creation of reverse- discourses such as the creation of homosexual identity). Foucault showed us how power and discourse came together to regulate the body, and individuals, through the four key strategies, and they were part of the medicalization of sex, or 'sexology' Also, by looking at work written since Foucault's exploration of sexuality, we can access his contribution by looking for his influence within...",You are a university student.

The fact that she fails to remain audit throughout is one of the key pessimistic views in the book, as she has failed this because of the class divisions.

To differentiate between pre-industrial growth and modern economic growth, we use Kuznet's definition of modern economic growth, which is summarized by the following 6 characteristics. The first criterion is to show high rates of growth per capita as well as growth in population. In other words, growth must not be associated with extensive growth, where GDP levels only rise because of a rise in population while standards of living remain the same. The second criterion is to show a high rate of growth per output per unit of all inputs. This means that there must be total factor productivity growth, where productivity of all inputs rises (e.g. not just a rise in output per labour). Thirdly, there must be a high rate of structural change in the economy. For example, a shift from an agriculturally based economy into an industrially and service based economy.

From the first witchcraft statute in 1542 to the repeal of the last in 1736 there were fewer than 1,000 executions for this crime; a figure of half this is probably closer to the mark.

However, a natural language is not so perfectly designed to transfer all the information in an expected way. More or less, some flaws in a language are inevitable, such as the ambiguity of a language which causes confusion in people's common utterances. Generally speaking, there are often certain ambiguous words and sentences appearing in human's utterances and acquiring more precise clarification from speakers. Different interpretations of the same utterance may result in various interpretations and the difficulty of comprehension of listeners. It is, actually, a quite common phenomenon among different languages. The purpose of this essay is to identify the types of ambiguity because sometimes it could be confusing in itself and with other phenomena. Therefore, this essay attempts to focus on explaining the basic types of ambiguity after a brief definition and some distinctions from other similar linguistic phenomena which are vagueness and deixis.

Discuss in relation to one or two post-classical re-workings.,"In today's society, as in that of Ancient Greece, the name 'Helen of Troy' symbolises the epitome of female beauty. One of the few female characters in the Iliad, an epic dominated by men and their concerns, namely war, Helen remains something of a mystery to us. While the written sources agree that she was the most beautiful of all women, they contradict each other on almost everything else about her.

It is my intention to examine the implications of the eighteenth and late nineteenth century luxury debates by employing these categories as a means of injecting a bit of order (albeit artificial) into the vast amount of literature written on this subject.

BAWE,BAWE_1095,Is there good reason to agree with Plato that properties are universals?,"In his 'Contemporary Metaphysics', Michael Jubien identifies properties in the Platonic sense as ""entities that exist apart from and independently of the things that have them""[1] Plato's belief that properties are universal stems from a long line of enquiry into the nature of justice, and his perception of the ideal state. Through question and answer sessions with the people he surrounds himself with, he slowly unravels his 'Theory of Forms' Although Plato has never explicitly stated this theory, many contemporary commentators recognise it as an intrinsic part of Plato's philosophies. Throughout his many texts are references to 'things-in-themselves', or 'ideas', which are used frequently to portray his beliefs about justice and other abstract entities. But because of the nature in which Plato reveals his Forms, commentators have failed to agree on his argument for their existence, some maintaining that he gives none at all. If this is right, then what reason do we have to adopt Plato's theory? In order to understand Plato's reasons for his theory of forms, we must first understand a little about the nature of properties as universals.

This was by the process of natural selection. A key aspect of Darwin's ideas was that species were not immutable, that they could change in their essential characteristics. It had been a common belief that species were immutable because of the writings in the Bible. Genesis mentioned the species that God had created and it was assumed that only God could create new species. Darwin was worried about the implications of his ideas. In January 1844 he wrote to J. D. Hooker claiming that it was 'like confessing a murder' to suggest that species were not immutable. However, many of Darwin's ideas had been in discussion by earlier natural historians and Romantic thinkers in the decades before he published his Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection in 1859. Romanticism began in the mid-eighteenth century and reached its height in the nineteenth century. The Romantics questioned old beliefs, requiring proof before they believed in something.

To be a feminist implies an implicit hatred of men and all traditional institutions which have been formed by them. Increasingly western politics removes feminism from its agenda considering female emancipation has been adequately achieved with the right to vote, work and other civil liberties having been awarded to women. However despite this conception the fact remains that women in Britain earn seventy six pence for every pound earned by men and worldwide women earn just fifty per cent of what men earn thus illustrating, to some extent, the challenge posed by feminism for any democracy promoting equality, freedom from oppression and basic human rights for all women.

The academic value of this enterprise must be judged, and the historian Norman Finkelstein astutely points out that 'currently all the rage in the ivory tower, memory is surely the most impoverished concept to come down the academic pike in a long time."" Yet despite this, 'the intensity of the debates about memory and the Holocaust has never abated."" The task at hand is perhaps even more disdainful because it is expressed in a normative statement, and seemingly, it beckons to the writer to take part in a doomed enterprise. The role of the impartial judge is one that is hard to play, and though it is acknowledged that the historian's task is not to judge, it is not entirely possible for the historian to distance herself from this issue, because she is necessarily the product of her time.

Deposits are found in many varied locales and are disposed of in different manners; they consist of myriad artefact typologies as well as cover a wide range of forms and functions. They also help archaeologists to form chronologies and chart the history of metal production as well the formation of certain societies. Deposition is a world wide phenomenon and exists in many eras from the Mesolithic to the medieval periods. But it is most well known and studied within the European arena (as well as the most stunning artefacts). Archaeologists have over the years presented many theories concerning the motivations behind deposition and have also proposed a set of categories to work with. One of the major theories concerning Bronze Age hoarding that has been presented by and argued for by archaeologists is relatively straightforward and logical, is that hoards are a direct response to warfare and periods of political and social unrest.

BAWE,BAWE_11,How useful is it to separate the 'form' of social life from its 'content'?,"The writing of Simmel on the discipline of sociology is characterised by a desire to reduce the study of society to its essence. Instead of viewing society as Durkheim did, that is, as a generic force working externally of the individual and reifying itself through organisational structures and artefacts, Simmel was rather concerned with giving a 'serious [...]analysis of the social bond' (Nisbit 1959: 479), which can be described as the reciprocally working relation between two or more social actors. He denounced the view that a society ""as such"" could exist outside individuals (Simmel 1971a: 27), preferring to build a sociological system from the individual's standpoint. In the first place, Simmel represented social interaction as the dynamic attempt to reconcile the opposite drives within each human being - 'for example, the individual and the group, the need for conformity and for individuation, the need for stability and for flexibility' (Abel 1959: 478). Despite the theoretical character of these opposites, Simmel believed all ""forms-of-sociation"" are to some extent conditioned by the tension between them. Secondly, Simmel sought to separate the forms these conflicting ways of behaving could take, and their socio-historically dependent content. The form thereby attains a certain ""objective"" quality,...",You are a university student. Write an essay on the topic How useful is it to separate the 'form' of social life from its 'content'?.,,,
BAWE,BAWE_957,"(4) Why has it been said that English 'has only two tenses'? Show how this claim is controversial, depending on how the notion of tense is characterised, and explain whether you are convinced by it.","<heading>Introduction</heading>Traditionally, grammar books have unreservedly referred to past, present and future tenses in English. This ternary view was derived from the Latin model of tense according to which events occur in one of these three timeframes and the verb form is correspondingly marked. The scope of tense-relations in this essay includes the past (represented in regular verbs by the suffix [-ed]), the present (represented in regular verbs by the suffix [-(e)s] for the third person singular) and the future (represented by the modal auxiliary 'will' and the infinitive). The aspectual (progressive) and phase (perfect) characteristics of the verb form constitute a necessary part of any discussion on how the occurrence of events is represented along the time continuum, however, these forms do not drive the analysis of tense as it is addressed here. From a purely structural perspective, some linguists claim that the three grammatical forms described above only offer the possibility of two 'true' tenses in English: the past and present (or non-past) as these alone exhibit an inflectional verbal form that marks tense, whereas the future form is only a periphrastic construction derived from one of the many functions of the modal auxiliary 'will'.

This is because he is one of the few dominant male characters that are written about in the novel. Esteban is obsessive, violent, and materialistic. He devotes his life to his business and political careers, determined first to become rich and then to become powerful. His granddaughter, Alba suggests he is tied up in the fate of the whole family and events as a whole, also suggesting that all the characters are linked in a 'terrible chain."" Therefore his place in the novel is decisive in determining the chain of events that take place. Additionally, Trueba has an important job in the narration of the novel as Allende gives him short passages of first person narration that no other character is allowed. Even Alba who writes out Clara's notes and tells the rest of the story from her perspective talks about herself in the third person.

British writers and poets of the genre faced personal, political and social moral dilemma on how best to portray the intensely personal yet estranged issue of slavery in the colonies. Said, in his book Culture and Imperialism, highlights the implications of such an impasse. Many writers, including Austen, used ""striking but careful strategies...positive ideas of home, of a nation and its language, of proper order, good behaviour and moral values. But positive ideas of this sort do more than validate 'our' world; they also tend to devalue other worlds."" Similarly, texts written by ex slaves also encountered difficulties on how to portray their experiences of slavery. Whether the purpose of a text was abolitionist propaganda or personal catharsis, an ex slave had to safeguard against offending a reader's sensibilities, whilst also pushing the boundaries on descriptions of slavery, so readers did not become complacent and continued to argue in favour of abolition. These tensions established a fine balance between the sublimation and disruption of slavery in Romantic texts.

BAWE,BAWE_288,Douglass North's Theory of Institutions: Key to Understanding Underdevelopment Today?,"Today's world is fraught with economic inequality: the breach between the incomes of 'Northern' countries and those of poorer 'Southern' countries is relentlessly widening. What explains such a trend? Why do some countries accumulate so much wealth while others become so radically poorer? Traditional economic theory has attributed underdevelopment to differences in resource endowments between rich and poor nations, or to Western exploitation of less developed states. Such theories, however, do not satisfactorily explain why underdevelopment persists in poor countries in spite of the guidance which more successful 'model' countries provide them with. Only recently has the persistence of underdevelopment been seriously considered; in particular, theorists such as Douglass North have looked to the role of institutions in shaping countries' economic performance. These scholars argue that institutions, when efficient, are vital to achieving modern economic growth; inefficient institutions based on incomplete information, however, irremediably harm economies' long-term development. Such claims can be investigated by looking into the role played by institutions in governmental structures, in long-distance trade, and in economic change throughout history.

It will also compare and contrast the societies they created including an examination into the factors which shaped their settlements such as relations with local Native American tribes and the influence of disease on the colonies. In general, the migrants to the Chesapeake were young, single males in search of wealth who were usually from poor backgrounds (many were servants), while migrants to New England were usually families seeking religious freedom from persecution in Europe, with less of an interest in wealth as they were already financially secure. This meant society in New England was far more stable.

BAWE,BAWE_77,When did American independence from Britain become inevitable?,"Although the Declaration of Independence was officially ratified on 4 th July 1776, now known as Independence Day, the process of gradual colonial independence from Britain had begun long before this historic day. However, this essay will argue that independence was not assured until after July 4 th 1776, because the war with Britain still had to be won. It is important to distinguish between when the Americans first declared independence and when it actually became inevitable. Britain was not simply going to acquiesce and let the Americans proclaim independence without resistance. Over decades, however, the Americans formed their own cultural identity and no longer felt as connected to the British as previously. A feeling of animosity subsequently developed especially over the issue of taxation which ultimately was one of the main factors in leading to the War of Independence. Even when war broke out between the two nations, independence was not the main objective for the colonies, because Americans were fighting purely for the defence of their rights. The turning point in terms of the Americans uniting behind the cause was in early 1776, but independence only finally became inevitable after the battle of Saratoga in spring 1777 where...",You are a university student.

Also, they consider the agreements achieved to be favoured for the interests of multinational businesses and richer economies rather than indigenous producers in local economies, whereas supporters of more liberal world trade argue that globalization brings benefits of wider access to markets and cheaper goods and services, the growth in trade that follows benefits both consumers and workers by encouraging innovation and investment, so from an economic point of view, free trade is very beneficial for all the countries involved.

The 'national game' commands the devoted attention of an overwhelming proportion of the country's population, receiving substantial and wide coverage across a plethora of media outlets. At the forefront of this devotion within Buenos Aires and the country nationwide is the fierce rivalry between 'Boca Juniors' and 'River Plate', famous internationally both as the most successful club sides and for the intense competition between them. Owing to the two clubs traditional association with opposite ends of the country's social and economic hierarchy, an Argentinian's choice of team, particularly that of 'Porteños' within Buenos Aires, entails an affiliation with a specific societal segment. Accordingly, Boca Juniors fans are fundamentally regarded as supporting a team of the people, with those of their River Plate counterparts theoretically tied to the country's upper echelons. As an internal societal phenomenon, the rivalry functioned throughout the twentieth century to reinforce people's notions of class and discrepancies in wealth.

As the population of the country as a whole doubled, the population of London quadrupled. In 1500 the population was just 50,000, but this had risen to 490,000 by 1700. There was a low fertility rate as only a small proportion of people were married and the poor living conditions in the capital resulted in a high mortality rate; yet the population continued to rise. The explanation for this comes from the high level of migration into the city. In order to counter the effects of low fertility and high mortality rates on the population, London needed around 7,000 migrants entering the city every year to grow at the rate it did. E.A Wrigley estimated that one in six people had lived in London at some stage in their life by the end of the seventeenth century. A. L. Beier and R.

BAWE,BAWE_130,How does neurobiological development constrain cognitive development?,"<heading>Introduction</heading>How does neurobiological development constrain cognitive development? The ambiguity in this question lies in the word 'constrain'. Cognitive development usually refers to the development of different cognitive skills (such as language) as one passes through childhood into adulthood. Alternatively, cognitive development may refer in a more general sense to the overall evolution of intellectual capacity during a person's life. Piaget's stage model exemplifies an attempt to describe cognitive development in this latter sense of the phrase, and aptitude tests such as WAIS are designed to describe it quantitatively. Neurobiological development on the other hand is the gradual unfolding and maturation of the brain as a result of hereditary and environmental influence. This biological development causes cognitive development, so in what sense can neural development constrain cognitive development? This question can perhaps be approached by looking at pathological as opposed to normal cognitive development. For instance, children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) develop small and malformed brains as a result of disproportionate amounts of alcohol in the womb. As a result they develop attentional and perceptual deficits, irritability and impulsivity, and general mental retardation (Passer & Smith, 2001).

The recent Clementi Report [2] and the following government response suggest that these calls are being answered. Yet surely there is more to this than pandering to public opinion? The question of reforming the regulatory system of the legal profession must require a careful analysis of the current system and a comparative understanding of the alternatives on offer. <heading>A self-regulating profession? </heading>The weight of criticism of the legal profession is rooted in the concept of 'self-regulation.' In an age of accountability, the idea of a 'closed-shop' of self-regulating professionals seems perverse. It may be argued, however, that the legal profession is not self-regulating at all. Taken literally, self-regulation suggests coterminous groups of regulators and regulated, whereas in fact the Law Society and Bar Council regulate all solicitors and barristers whether or not they are subscribing members. This pedantic approach is not the only argument for a reclassification of the legal profession's regulatory system. Most of the regulatory powers of the governing bodies have been entrusted to the by Parliament. Due to the constitutional doctrine of parliamentary...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_443,Multi-Level Governance fails to enhance our Appreciation of the European Union's Complex Policy. A Critique,"<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>The multi-level governance approach provides the conceptual framework for a new agenda in European studies which is concerned with comprehending the paradoxical nature of the policy system. Multi-level governance may be regarded as an advance in the comprehension of the EU polity because it provides the possibility to break free from the traditional preoccupation with the contradiction between national and supranational authority and prescribes for an explanation of how the system works. Multi-level governance is analysed here in order to show how the shortcomings of traditional explanations of the EU can be overcome. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates how the multi-level governance approach advances our understanding of the EU's complex polity. The multi-level governance framework conceptualises a system of governance open to a variety of theoretical perspectives in order to explain an abundance of constitutive issue areas. The assumption is not that the multi-level governance approach constitutes a theory in its own right. However, this essay attempts to demonstrate that theory can be developed within the multi-level governance framework with an assessment of three areas of scholarship: Europeanisation, New Institutionalism and Policy Network Analysis. Finally, it is argued that Giandomenico Majone's theory of regulatory policy in the EU provides an example...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_296,THE ENGLISH LAW ON VICARIOUS LIABILITY IS THE BEST COMPROMISE WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN REACHED BETWEEN THE NEEDS OF TORT VICTIMS FOR COMPENSATION AND THE FREEDOM OF BUSINESSES TO OPERATE WITHOUT EXCESSIVE BURDENS.,"A common replacement for the phrase 'vicarious liability' is the Latin expression 'respondeat superior'. This literally means, 'let the principle answer'. This is a very apt description of the English law relating to tortuous vicarious liability. Our common law dictates that when a tort arises inside an employee's 'scope of employment' (usually described as the normal tasks they are expected to carry out in the course of their job), the employer will also incur liability for his employee's actions and any subsequent consequences. Of course, this seemingly harsh approach requires some guidelines to ensure that employers are not simply used as a way for employees to 'pass the buck' as it were. The most questioned point of fact in cases of vicarious liability is whether the employee was actually an employee. There is no specifically defined test to establish this, but the intention of both parties, the degree of control the employer has over his employee, and the employee's 'integration' within the business are among the factors taken into consideration by the courts. If an employer-employee relationship is found, then vicarious liability is enabled. <fnote>Stevenson Jordan & Harrison Ltd. v MacDonald & Evans [1952] 1 TLR 101, per Lord Denning...",You are a university student.

The shift away from a bipolar distribution of power that these analysts have in mind, however, is only one aspect of this transformation; perhaps more importantly, the stage of world politics has recently been invaded by a host of transnational actors. As transnational cooperations, non-governmental organisations and superstate institutions gain influence in global debate, they may ""call into question the primacy of states"" by challenging their sovereignty. Some even warn that international organisations can be used by powerful states as tools to secure their hegemony. These somewhat pessimistic forecasts may be exaggerated, however; if transnational actors can be made accountable to civil society, they will more likely reform rather than annihilate the Westphalian system.

This was a massive turning point for modern medicine: the battle against infectious disease, which most believed had been won, was not yet over (Sontag, 1990, p.72). AIDS first came to prominence through the appearance of a number of patients marked by the experience of a cocktail of illnesses, including pneumonia, CMV (cytomegalovirus, belonging to the herpes virus family) and Karposi's sarcoma (a skin disease). These cases, initially concentrated in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, were highlighted as decidedly unusual without ""a clinically apparent underlying immunodeficiency"" (CDC report 1981, cited in Grmek, 1990, p.5). From here, Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was born, the latter stage of an infection 'characterised by advancing destruction of key elements of the immune system' (Alonzo and Reynolds, 1995, p.306), and later found to have the HIV virus as its root cause.

BAWE,BAWE_2,"Discuss the implications for women, in gender and class terms, of the rise of medicine as a profession","Since the fourteenth century the practice of medicine has become a profession, and more importantly, a male-dominated profession. Previously medicine was seen as a female duty, however all areas of medicine have been professionalized over the centuries, and slowly become male-dominated, even the practice of obstetrics, which until the twentieth century, was still viewed as a female responsibility. This rise of medicine has had many implications for women; in this essay I will discuss them. The most important, both in terms of gender and class, was the exclusion of women from what had previously been a female occupation, and their confinement into inferior areas of medicine. However I will also examine the effects the rise of the profession of medicine had on women in relation to how women were viewed from the nineteenth century onward, and also the practical impacts that it had upon women receiving treatment, especially in the case of childbirth. In terms of class I will look at how working-class women received different treatments, as a result of the rise of medicine as a profession, and also how, consequently, the divisions between working-class and upper-class women increased.

This way of thinking about the birth of a capitalist society, however, fails to recognise the two sides to the changes that took place. After all, not only was there rapid increase in supply, also was demand of consumer goods ever increasing (McCracken 1990:5). Earlier examples of cultural consumerism in various forms of frequent local gift exchange could already be found in the late eighteenth-century (Finn 2000:143). However, consumerism in the Victorian period took a different and much more broad-based shape through various agents, of which most importantly department stores and an 'unparalleled advertising craze' (Loeb 1994:5). And while men in the eighteenth-century were themselves participating consumers in an informal, pre-capitalist local economy, in the last decades of the nineteenth century mass advertisement of an impersonal character began to target almost only women as their potential customers (Loeb 1994:8) in a highly formalised mass commercial economy. The departure from a semi-formal, local economy to this increasingly enlarged scale of consumption of various kinds of consumer goods did not occur without protest or debate (Rappaport 1996).

The proportion of boys committing and being sentenced for crime far outweighs the number of girls. In 1999, whilst a quarter of young men had offended, only one in 10 young women had (Flood-Page et al 1998/1999 :55). In the past this differentiation as been unrecognised, but more recently research has attempted to explain what accounts for the differences in offending between girls and boys. In this essay I argue that there are differences in offending patterns between girls and boys and these result from gender based influences (impact of attitudes) rather than differences in sex (biological aspects) (Heidensohn 1989 :88). The evidence to support this argument is split into three categories. Firstly, different attitudes to bringing up boys and girls - boys are allowed to be boys (Worrall and Hoy 2004:190), whist girls must conform to models of femininity (Hudson in Cain 1989 :197).

BAWE,BAWE_134,Bertrand competition is more 'intense' than Cournot competition. Discuss.,"The Bertrand and Cournot competition models both relate to an oligopoly. An oligopoly is a market with relatively few firms but many buyers. It is characterised by each firm recognising their mutual interdependence and therefore acting strategically as well as the fact that the goods sold within the market are usually close substitutes. Under the Cournot model firms behave strategically with respect to the quantity of the good produced whereas under the Bertrand Model the firms compete through prices. When comparing the intensity of Bertrand competition with Cournot competition it is vital to be clear about the meaning of intensity. The most common meaning in this context is how close to perfect competition each model is. The closer to perfect competition, the more intense the competition is. Another way of looking at this is how much tolerance the market gives to inefficient firms. The lower the tolerance to inefficient firms the more intense the competition. Using this definition the Bertrand model, assuming homogeneous goods, can be seen to have significantly more intense competition. Under differentiated products the competition can still be seen to be more intense under Bertrand, however, the Cournot and Bertrand models move much closer together and the...",You are a university student.

In this essay we shall look at such cultural representations in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, and assess the extent to which they contributed to the construction of a national identity. Naturally, art forms such as dance and music were, even though powerful, not the only way of expressing one's national sentiments. The first films with sound managed to reach a mass audience and demonstrated what it was like to be a true Argentine, or Brazilian, in a light package.

However, the real stimuli to trade came with the arrival of the French and especially the English East India Company in India.

In the past, study has been primarily dominated by the biological differences between 'man' and 'woman', however as Brown and Jordanova (1982) point out ""biological differences do not provide a universal basis for social definitions. What cultures make of sex differences is almost infinitely variable, so that biology cannot be playing a determining role. Women and men are products of social relations, if we change the social relations we change the categories 'woman' and 'man'"" (cited in Moore, 1988, p7).

Due to historical reasons, there are large differences between international corporate governance systems (Witt, 2004). However, much attention has surrounded the issues on whether national corporate governance systems will converge and if occurs, which direction it is towards to. Without neglecting those matters, the essay emphasises on the factors which might be considered to undermine the national distinctive system of corporate governance, with a fairly deep reference to Germany. The German corporate governance is a typical example of the stakeholder value orientation. It is worthy analysing the dynamic process of changes in Germany together with finding out the driven forces. The essay consists of four sections. Section one provides general arguments about the convergence of corporate governance and the possible reasons. Based on the German case, the second section...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_21,Vehicle of Propaganda or Agent of Subversion? Cold War Hollywood Bomb Cinema 1950-1963.,"For too long the history of the Cold War has been written from a 'top-down' perspective examining elites and decision-makers. Whilst political scientists have become mired in using rational International Relations models, historians have rarely cast their net beyond realpolitik, frequently falling foul of detailed narrative around contingencies which often never occurred. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the 30-year rule for many documents in the West, which both led to a spate of archival-based sources available to historians, cemented this diplomatic and empirical approach. Moreover, archival work alone is a dangerous place from which to survey the Cold War, since both sides of the Iron Curtain employed 'newspeak' rather than rational discourse, even behind closed doors. In short, this 'New Cold War history' can become overly narrative driven and blind to broader analysis. However, as a result of the growing interest in cultural history following the 1980s 'linguistic turn', recent study, particularly in the so called 'Constructivist' school, has challenged Cold War historians to spread their wings methodologically, and explore the culture of the conflict. In spite of noteworthy 'hot' episodes, such as Vietnam, the Cold War was in most part a conflict...",You are a university student.

In many ways it was not the strike itself that generated developments but the media frenzy surrounding the episode. The publicity and widespread sympathy among republicans for those on hunger strike in Long Kesh/Maze prison shook Sinn Fein leadership into taking a more political stance. The episode the threatened political stability of the entire country and urgently required both the British and Republicans to identify their objectives. As a result Sinn Fein realised the potential of a political strategy and made the significant decision to participate in elections. A major impact of the hunger strike was the sizable increase in electoral support which Sinn Fein and by association, the IRA gained. In what Tonge describes as the 'electorally barren' Irish Republic, sections of the Northern Irish population who had previously abstained from elections were politicised. Young militant activists from Republican ghettos in particular, were mobilised to vote for the first time.

Roman religion was based around a public, state funded sphere and a private sphere. Although people were permitted to worship the Emperor as a living god in the private cults, state worship of the living emperor was never a feature of Roman religion. Instead of worshipping the living emperor as a god, the state cult performed rituals for the emperor's Genius, or divine spirit. The State cult also worshipped the dead emperors, the Divi imperators, who, it was believed, were deified upon their death. This essay will investigate whether the Romans believed their emperor to be a god, and will examine the beliefs present in the state and private cults. The worship of the emperor varied greatly in the public and private spheres of Roman religion. The religions of Rome did not have a central governing body, such as a Papacy. As a result, religion was essentially divided into three main spheres, consisting of household, private and state.

However, the recent legal developments have been to the detriment of the floating charge holders. Although the Enterprise Act (EA) 2002, the Companies Act (CA) 2006 and the House of Lords decision in National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus and others have clarified the law, the floating charges have become less lucrative to lenders. As a result of the reforms, the floating charge holders are afforded less protection and have a lower priority in insolvency situations. This is particularly problematic for small companies, because they rely heavily on the floating charge as a security for their debt. Due to the recent changes, banks and other lenders are likely to become more reluctant to give loans to companies with little or no fixed assets. Therefore, it has been argued that the reforms have undermined the benefits of the floating charge.

In particular, Aristotle's 'Poetics' was rediscovered and 'was taken as a rulebook for literary composition.' (86) In it, Aristotle examines the most successful tragedies of his time and then lists the ingredients essential to make a good play. By the Renaissance, Aristotle's authority had grown to such a point that these suggestions were taken as absolutes against which all plays were judged. In particular, the 'Poetics' stipulate that a play should follow one action without digression and that the action should take place within the space of one day, and in one location only. These unities of action, time and place form the basic framework for writing a play.

Moreover use of language is different depending on certain groups of identity in particular gender differences between male and female enable to vary styles of language or lexical expressions widely. Furthermore these distinctions seem to emphasise a sense of identity such as masculinity or femininity as behaviours or attitudes. This essay will firstly discuss how men's language and women's language are dissimilar from three points. These points are vocabulary, speech styles and ways of interaction. In addition this essay will move to analyse how these differences are made while taking consideration of social life in early childhood and social relations in genders and then conclude on how much linguistic identity is important in establishing a sense of identity between genders in social context.

The existence of massive difference in the standard of living all over the world made economists to find the causation of lower living standard in poor countries and the possible ways of helping them to grow faster and catch up with rich ones.

However, capital accumulation alone cannot explain the persistent growth in living standards.

America has an elections culture where there are a lot of elections, ranging from state, local and congressional elections to national elections however it does lack an active voting culture to match up to it. According to a statistical ranking (by Norman J Ornstein, Thomas E. Mann and Michael J Malbin) on the proportion of the voting-age population casting ballots in the most recent national elections as of 2001 in various democracies, America is ranked 23 rd with an average of 52.1 percent as compared to the first three high ranking countries; Greece with 89 percent, Iceland with 86.2percent and Italy with 84.9 percent. Moreover, it is even more astonishing as the number of voters has declined from the high point in 1960 despite the numerous stimulating effects of increased education, reduced legal barriers and loosening of registration laws that should facilitate voting.

In short, eugenics theoretically aims at the improvement the characteristics of man via the study of heredity and the subsequent application of this knowledge to human reproduction. Thus in practice this entails curbing reproduction between those with ""inferior"" characteristics (negative eugenics) and encouraging it among those possessing valuable qualities (positive eugenics). Such eugenic science was practically legislated for in many states of the U.S.A. and in Germany. Many U.S. states had laws for the sterilisation of the ""feebleminded"", for example, including epileptics, manic-depressives, prostitutes, alcoholics, the homeless and criminals, and the 1924 Immigration Restriction Act prevented people of certain ethnic backgrounds entering the country. Nazi Germany followed suit during the 1930s where the Law on Preventing Hereditarily Ill Progeny called for the ""hereditarily sick"" to be sterilised and later, bringing ethnicity into eugenics, the Nuremburg Laws prevented inter-marriage or sexual relations between Jews and non-Jews. <fnote>Davenport, quoted in Haller, Mark H., Eugenics: Hereditarian Attitudes in American Thought (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1963), p.3 </fnote>The memory of what happened as...","You are a university student.

Indeed, existing criticism always qualifies any statements made to liken them. One critic has even moved from remarking on a resemblance, albeit relatively slight, in saying that, 'Jane Austen's novels could, indeed, be called educational novels though they bear little resemblance to the 'Bildungsromane' of Goethe' (Klieneberger 33), to reminding the reader that, 'It is significant that Jane Austen whose work marks the transition from the eighteenth-century novel of manners to the social realism of the nineteenth-century, should have started her career [....] by satirizing Werther and the novel of sensibility' (Klieneberger 15). What can we make of this? Certainly, there are some major differences not only between the novels themselves, but also between their conception. Whereas 'Jane Austen no more drew her houses from life than she did her characters' (Nicolson 11), contemporary readers of The Sorrows of Young Werther were fully aware that Werther's love for Lotte was based on Goethe's unrequited love for a certain Charlotte Buff.

BAWE,BAWE_430,What conclusions should one draw about the 'self' from Goffman's work?,"Erving Goffman, writing in the post-war period, is one of the last century's most acclaimed sociological writers. The accessible style of his work has made it some of the most widely read, providing insight into the vast symbolic significance of social interaction. Characteristics shared with Simmel's style of essayism are clear; Goffman's assertions, like his, are not generally backed up with empirical evidence. This is not necessarily a criticism however, as it allows his style the charm that has made the pieces so popular and comprehensible. Goffman's work hinges on the notion that 'all human beings are vulnerable to the constraint of social interaction' (Fisher and Strauss, 1979, p.479). As a result, his work is often cited as part of the Chicago school tradition of symbolic interactionism. Their concern was to investigate those social actions that have an 'immediately reciprocal orientation' (Joas, 1987, p.84), on the basis that such actions have a symbolic character. Mead's conception that individuals partaking in interaction both give out and receive gestures and signals, was one important work to come out of the Chicago school, which one would perhaps tend to associate as the basis of Goffman's concern with the construction of 'self'.

I would say this is a very valid argument: it demonstrates that the engineer has spent a considerable amount of time studying the discipline and reached a level of competency recognised and approved by the governing bodies of engineering. Having an accredited degree in engineering should certainly ensure that high level engineering, such as large scale bridges or buildings or complicated (and consequently potentially dangerous) machinery, are built to a certain standard. With this level of study in engineering principals to the degree that they are accredited, we have confidence that they are constructed well by knowledgeable and experienced engineers - engineers whom we should consider to be professionals.

This is partly because it represents a rare convergence of interests between food manufacturers, medical scientists and government agencies. It is a controversial matter because it has resulted in the so-called ""medicalisation"" of the food supply, that is, using food and/or food components to treat and prevent diseases, the area traditionally reserved for drug development.

'Passionlessness' was initially an ideology created by men as a form of controlling women and thus society. Without economic or political independence, women could only manipulate the ideology to their best advantage rather than overturning it completely. The ideology meant that, 'middle-class women lost their association with lust and instead were invested with the quality of innate purity."" In addition, 'passionlessness' did not just apply to pre-marital chastity, but was expected within marriage for the first time. The condition of 'passionlessness' in a woman, therefore, became the centrepiece to the ideal social unit - the family.

BAWE,BAWE_529,Outline Jackson's 'knowledge argument' and evaluate one argument with which a physicalist might respond,"Jackson first presented the knowledge argument as a response to Physicalism in his 1982 work ""Epiphenomenal Qualia"". Physicalism is the doctrine that knowledge of the physical world is the only knowledge possible, and that the only true facts are those expressible in the language of the physical sciences. Jackson's claim is that this view denies or fails to adequately define the subjective features of experience. His apparently simple explanation for this is that one may know everything there is to know about human consciousness and experience, and yet fail to know facts about what these experiences are like subjectively. He uses the famous example of Mary to illustrate this. <fnote>Jackson, F.

BAWE,BAWE_61,Discuss how psychological research you have learned about in this course relates to each of THREE criminal or civil cases chosen from any Commonwealth country or from the US.,"<heading>Introduction</heading>This essay aims to discuss three areas of psychological phenomena that have been found to account for a vast number of wrongful convictions, tragically affecting the lives of many people. It appears that the majority of wrongful convictions arise from eyewitness error (Wells, 1993). In light of this, this essay will use criminal cases to demonstrate how false memories could be induced into eyewitness accounts, by examining both child suggestibility and hypnotism, and will also how, even without the implementation of false memories, the complete misidentification of a suspect is possible. From a legal standpoint it is extremely necessary to be aware of these psychological phenomena and their effects on individuals, as it could help to not only diminish the amount of wrongful convictions, but also help convict more of the guilty. <heading>Case of Kelly Michaels: Child Suggestibility & Repeated Questioning</heading>The case of Kelly Michaels aptly demonstrates how highly suggestible children can be.

BAWE,BAWE_338,Critically discuss research on the verbal and non-verbal correlates of lying and comment on the prospects for reliable detection.,"Communication is the facilitation of information from one source to another. Humans communicate to let others know our wants, desires and feelings. Interaction is done on a daily basis using both verbal and non-verbal types of communication. Verbal communication entails information transferred through the contents of vocal speech. Non-verbal communication involves any other means of communicating that does not consist of vocal content. In the daily form of communication, occasionally a person might use deception to conceal information they do not want others to know. A son may need to lie to his parents about his whereabouts or a husband to his wife about whether he has done the household chores. ""Lying is a stressful and anxiety arousal experience."" (Siegman & Feldstein, 1987, 314) As such, repressed and concealed emotions are likely to find an outlet to release. This usually results in types of behaviour that can be classified as cues of deception. These cues can be released either non-verbally or verbally. Non-verbal communication in relation to deception has been studied in detail numerous times with the same few conclusions.

BAWE,BAWE_764,Compare the 'functionalisms' of Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown,"Both Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown used the basic premise of 'functionalism', but each utilised it in a very different way (Leach, 1966, p6). Both of these scholars begin their theories on the basis that a culture or a society ""is an empirical whole made up of a limited number of readily available identifiable parts"" (Leach, 1966, p6), however Malinowski observed 'institutions' to be functionally connected into a balanced mechanism, subsequently being coined functionalism, whereas Radcliffe-Brown was more inclined to the 'organic analogy', whereby cultures could be seen as working in the same respect as organisms (Leach, 1966), alternatively being named structural-functionalism. An excellent comparison of the two is made by Leach (1966), relating the two to time pieces ""Radcliffe-Brown was concerned, as it were, to distinguish wrist watches from grandfather clocks, whereas Malinowski was interested in the general attributes of clockwork"" (Leach, 1966, p6) As this essay has begun by defining the charismatic differences between the two of these scholars it makes sense to go into these differences in more detail.

BAWE,BAWE_396,Examine the relation between the supernatural and the real in Hoffmann's Der goldne Topf.,"The Age of the Enlightenment in Germany was followed by a radically different movement. Romanticism rebelled against the notion that one could rely on science and religion for answers. Rationality was abandoned in order to portray 'an image of nature in which man is caught up in the tragic dichotomy between human existence as the sad reality it is and the inspired reality it should be' (Taylor 9). E.T.A. Hoffmann recognised this 'dichotomy', and it is his Der goldne Topf which perhaps best embraces that Sehnsucht for a greater existence characteristic to the work of all the Romantics. However, the 'Maerchen aus der neuen Zeit', as Hoffmann himself called it, is preoccupied more specifically with another dichotomy - that is, the realm of the supernatural and the dominion of the real. It is the relation between the supernatural and the real in Der goldne Topf which I shall examine in the following essay. Hoffmann's many tales often begin with a precise geographical and temporal description. In Die Jesuitkirche in G. , the story begins as the narrator arrives in front of an inn at the market place in Glogau, Silesia (Taylor, 60).

Groups tend to polarize towards the given majority and individuals often become more extreme in their preferences after the group discussion compared to before (Myers and Kaplan, 1976). The mediating mechanism operating between the pre and the post decision is the deliberation process. Deliberation has a large impact on jury decision making, which is reliant upon individual jurors discussing the evidence as a group, and returning with an often unanimous verdict. The majority of research on the jury has focused upon how individual jurors reach a verdict before the discussion, such as studies supporting the Story Board Model of juror decision making (Pennington and Hastie, 1992). Although this is a theory investigating how the individual decides upon a verdict, it does have implications for the deliberation process. There have also been attempts to produce Social Decision Schemes to assess the probability of deliberation resulting in a guilty, not guilty or hung verdict, depending upon pre deliberation verdicts (Davis, Kerr, Stasser, Meek and Holt, 1977).

Voluntary euthanasia requires a competent patient's explicit request for death to be brought about. This includes active voluntary euthanasia, which involves a third party bringing about death of the patient himself or assisting in the final act of death ('physician-assisted suicide' in the context of the medical profession). Passive voluntary euthanasia entails the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment at the request of a competent patient. Involuntary euthanasia, on the other hand, is absent of any request. The decision is made on the patient's behalf regarding his best interests. Involuntary active euthanasia can be distinguished from involuntary passive euthanasia in that the moment of death is caused by an action and cannot be attributed to natural causes. Currently the law in England and Wales prohibits assisted suicide under section 2 of the Suicide Act 1961. Omissions, however, do not fall within the scope of this legislation. Bland illustrates the legal distinction between acts and omissions. The House of Lords held that it was lawful to withhold artificial nutrition and hydration as well as antibiotics by categorising the cessation of such treatment as an omission.

The first requires regularities in the physical world; the second requires associations in the mind. Hume talks as if we can accept either or both but it appears that we need to accept both to fully grasp the intricacies involved in describing cause and effect. The first, physical definition, says that something is a cause if it is contiguous and precedent to some other object and where 'all the objects resembling the former are placed in like relations of precedence and contiguity to those objects that resemble the latter' (Section 14, Treatise of Human Nature). It is not apparent what Hume means by objects resembling each other. Do they have to be identical to each other? Or is there some scope for variety? If there is some scope for variety and difference then it is difficult to see where Hume would draw the line, and say that an event no longer resembles the one being analysed, but resembles some other event instead.

It is quite possible now to keep a brain stem dead patient alive for many years. But this is neither beneficial nor humane for the patient concerned. The clinician, in this scenario, is prolonging life just because he has the capacity to and not because it is in the patients' best interests. Ethical arguments have therefore brought into contention the role of the clinician in these scenarios- are they prolonging life or are they prolonging the process of dying?

Practices such as free trade and deregulation policies became so widespread that they came to be known as ""The Washington Consensus"". Even the end of History, with the final triumph of Capitalism, was heralded. Hedge Funds, as will see below, are not in any way the product of neo-liberalism. They were, at least in their most recent form, much fostered by some of its facets, such as deregulation and liberalisation of capital flows, which were much aided by the coming of the Internet. But globalisation is not without its drawbacks. At this point, a parallel with taxation may be helpful, for at least some of the challenges Hedge Funds present are similar to those faced by regulators as to tax shopping before the enactment of transfer pricing rules - in that the dilemmas our issue presents can never be efficiently tackled solely from the perspective of a single country, even though regulation is intrinsically a sovereign governmental activity, not easily made compatible with a global strategy.

A pure monopoly, which is a single supplier to a market, will not reach this outcome, unlike perfect competition that is synonymous with efficiency. This is because while they produce a level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (provided they do not shut down), as a price maker they will introduce a wedge between marginal cost and the price. Hence the market will no longer convey accurate information about production costs and thus consumer decisions will no longer reflect true opportunity costs of production, as price no longer equals marginal cost, which leads to an inefficient allocation of resources. Essentially, the question we are asking is what are the factors affect the size of the wedge between marginal cost and price?

However, in recent years historians have become increasingly sceptical of such clear sectional divisions and there has been an upsurge in work examining the many similarities that remained even throughout the warring period. My aim here is to use such work to examine whether a stress upon the similarities, or instead the differences between the sections is more useful and/or potentially accurate to the historian interested in this period of American history.

Discuss.","The decline in voting in Britain, at all levels of government, has given the impression of a decline in popular participation, and seems to suggest an apathetic electorate who do not care about becoming engaged in politics or democracy. However, to infer this simply from studying electoral turnout ignores the multiple 'entrance points' into modern politics, which allow for people to become engaged in democratic participation in non-traditional ways. Although there is a decline in voting, interest groups especially single issue groups, are flourishing. There is also an increasing trend of participating on an individual level; activities such as boycotting certain products, or buying fair trade goods. This reflects the changing nature of democracy, not just in Britain, but in the world as a whole. With increasing consensus in 'Westminster' politics, and Britain as a whole, on traditional economic and welfare issues, there has been a shift towards participation on behalf of 'post-materialist' issues, which has shaped this change in the way we participate, and the focus of participation.

Central to the debate are two questions: whether or not abortion should ever be justified in law ('the First Question'); and if answered in the positive, in what circumstances should abortion be permitted ('the Second Question'). Despite the on-going controversy, the English legal position has moved forward by the enactment of the Abortion Act 1967 and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. In general, the law allows abortion in specific circumstances, thus answering the First Question in the positive, while pragmatically addressing the Second Question by setting out certain statutory grounds. However, a closer examination of the English abortion law in the context of foetal disability reveals that the current law is fails to distinguish those circumstances satisfactorily. By drawing the American legal position as a complementary approach, it is contended that a rights-based approach would give a better result in the balancing exercise than the current approach adopted in the UK. <heading>The English abortion debate</heading>Abortion, in general, raises complex moral, ethical and legal issues.

BAWE,BAWE_5,Consider how Victorian notions of women's madness affected the lives of women in class specific ways,"Victorian notions of women's madness were largely influenced by the Victorian Domestic Ideology; paramount during the nineteenth century in defining gender roles, responsibilities and acceptable behaviour. This primarily concerned the middle classes, establishing ideals of womanhood and femininity that were arguably damaging both to those directly targeted as well as other groups within Victorian society striving to emulate the middle class depiction of morality, sobriety and modesty. At the same time, the notion of madness as a disease was becoming increasingly apparent within Victorian society, further highlighting gender and class divisions through varying perceptions of madness and its origins. Whilst there were significant implications in terms of gender, this essay will mainly deal with the effects of social class on women's experience of madness in Victorian England. Firstly, it is important to understand that madness, in all its various forms, was seen as a female illness. Femininity became inextricably linked with hysteria, along with neurasthenia and anorexia nervosa. The main reasoning for this is to be found in the prevailing misogynistic understanding of female sexuality in nineteenth century England. Women were viewed as emotionally unstable as a result of the functions of their reproductive organs, the precise workings of which...",You are a university student.

In order to get the most out of the small period we had for the business plan we thought time management was very essential for this project. Hence we had more frequent and longer meetings for our business plan compared to our presentation. In our first meeting we decided to follow a regularity pattern of work. In this meeting we divided the work among ourselves, and each member had to research about the topic given to them, so that in the next meeting we could discuss it and try to think of what more we could do to progress our plan. I think this was a very good way to work as it allowed people to feel like they were working towards the project.

BAWE,BAWE_426,"Discuss and evaluate, with the use of examples, the extent to which social control has become a prime function of modern medicine.","Modern medicine is the product of ongoing change and progression. Where once medicine held a relatively narrowly delineated position, today it is a complex and highly organised socio-political institution (Lupton, 1995, p.2). Its role within our society has altered significantly, becoming increasingly encompassing in its scope. Many contemporary writers indicate the way in which medicine as an institution has taken over various functions previously overseen by religion or the law (Illich, 1995, p.1652) and it is here that its potential to exert social control must be placed. When one uses such terminology in relation to modern medicine, it is important not to consider only the direct, often violent, coercion of peoples that the term can imply. Social control is defined as the encouraging, or enforcing, of particular types of behaviour through the establishment of social norms, where that which does not meet the norms is deemed deviant. In this wider perspective, it is far easier to conceptualise the ways in which medicine might become coercive and controlling. A good place to begin when examining the social control element of modern medicine is the idea of surveillance. The notion of surveillance medicine is something closely associated with Foucault's theories on discipline,...","You are a university student.

However, neither has a clear organic, medical cause and has multiple symptoms, such as bad dreams, insomnia, fidgetiness, impotence, claustrophobia and vague pains.

This topic is incredibly controversial and appears very frequently in the news. Naturally, consumers are wary about new technologies as no one can predict the long term effects of genetically modified food, even with detailed scientific research and trials. Most consumers rely on the media to make their judgment on genetically modified food. These sources do provide information but some tend to be bias and simplified. This may mean consumers lose the right to an informed decision due to the lack of information available to them. The consumer concerns will be considered to see if they are justified but also the benefits that genetically modified food may hold for the world will be examined. Also the background of genetically modified organisms and how they are created will be explored.

BAWE,BAWE_243,Did the Spanish 'spiritual conquest' fail in sixteenth-century Peru?,"The conquest of the Inca empire in 1532 saw the creation of a nascent model of colonial government, beginning a period in which Spain would endeavour to establish control over its new territory. Owing to its erstwhile conquering successes, Spain had an established tradition of assimilation, bringing conquered peoples under the crown's jurisdiction through conversion and allegiance to the Catholic Church. The notion of a 'spiritual conquest' pertained to the degree to which, following initial military and political subjugation, the colonists were able to proselytize the various indigenous inhabitants of its newly acquired regions. By the time of the conquest of Peru however, enthusiasm for evangelization had declined markedly within the Church and governmental authorities, with circumstances in Peru itself further constraining the enactment of a theological conquest. Internecine feuding, sustained Indian insurgency, and an inauspicious set of geographical facets meant that indigenous groups largely retained their traditional spiritual tenets in the initial years. However, even during the proceeding years of greater royal colonial control and organization of the Indians under Francisco de Toledo's Viceroyalty, full evangelization became effectively marginalized by the priority of establishing control over a part of the crown's empire that had strayed unpalatably far into private...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_337,How does sensation become perception?,"Sensation is an impression on the consciousness from a stimulation of the senses. Perception is the recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli based mostly on memory. A sensation does not occur without a perception following. Humans utilize their senses to perceive their surrounding environment. To make sense of their connection, one has to delve into the biological beginnings. The science of sensation is called psychophysics. Psychophysics is concerned with physical stimuli of the senses and the occurring psychological reactions. Perception is an individual incidence and to be able to study them, psychologists have reduced these perceptions to numbers. Simply put, sensation is a physical response to a stimulus that is converted to a perception in the brain. On a very different note, an exception to the sensation/perception link is perceptual illusions. The occurrences of perceptual illusions imply that what we sense from our sense organs is not necessarily what we perceive it to be. (Sternberg, 1999) We utilize our sensory information and manipulate it in our minds to create a mental picture that connects to a previous memory.

John Donne was born into a staunch Catholic family in Elizabethan England. At this time, followers of this religion were sensible to display an outward obedience to the Protestant consensus in order to avoid persecution. At the accession of James I to the English throne, there was little adjustment to the oppressive, religious framework laid out by Queen Elizabeth in the sixteenth century. While the pacifistic king offered greater freedoms for Catholics, it was clear that Catholicism in England was becoming an old, dying tradition which suffered a severe decline in numbers with the passing of each decade. Donne proved to be no exception to the masses who sought to protect their interests by rejecting their socially damaging roots. Donne's conversion to the Church of England allowed him greater access to employment and connections, which were formerly restricted by his faith, such as his position as Member of Parliament. It would be unreasonable to suggest that Donne abandoned personal, theological beliefs in his decision to leave the Catholic Church, as his passionate concern with his relationship...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_938,Can the food Industry be blamed for the increase in obesity in the UK?,"The food industry has been criticised for the increase in obesity in the UK. Consumers argue that labelling on foods is misleading and that marketing ploys are used to trick them into buying unhealthy products. While these may be valid points, and perhaps we are occasionally tempted by the aptly placed confectionery selection at the till, personal responsibility and consumer choice cannot be rendered blameless. In the following essay I intend to explore the extent to which the food industry can be blamed for the increase in obesity in the UK taking into account the changing lifestyle of the consumer. Obesity in England has tripled over the last 20 years and continues to rise. Most adults are overweight and one in five is obese. Treating obesity costs the NHS at least half a billion pounds a year. It is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and respiratory problems and contributed to 30,000 premature deaths in 1998.

Many sceptics claim that money permeates the entire political system, especially in two key areas, election campaigns, and interest group influence. These claims are backed up by some incredible statistics. For instance, in the 2004 election cycle, all but four of the Senate elections were won by the highest spending candidate, and in the House, this was all but ten; therefore, out of 469 Congressional elections in 2004, 455 were won by the highest spender. Although it is incredibly difficult to prove that money is the overriding influence in US politics (although the upcoming trial of Jack Abramoff could make this inference more accurate) it is widely regarded as true that, without money in US politics, you barely stand a hope of influencing the system in any way, and exceptions to this rule are highly sporadic.

BAWE,BAWE_251,Examine the Indian position and response to Creole republicanism in nineteenth century postcolonial Peru.,"Breaking formally with Spain in 1821, postcolonial Peru would witness significant changes in the state's approach to its indigenous majority and the ""Indian problem"". Peru emerged after independence as thoroughly divided, comprising an ethnically heterogeneous peasant mass scattered throughout a diverse landscape, and a small pool of largely city-residing elites determined to secure national progress. Influenced by the core ideals of La Ilustración and a Bolivarian desire to extirpate colonialism's despotic legacy, the limeño ruling class pursued a republican project of integration to secure its position at the apex of national authority. In line with this enterprising trajectory, the tribute and provincial cacique systems were abolished in the immediate post-independence years, furthering the colonial assault on the indigenous nobility begun in the wake of the Túpac Amaru rebellion of 1780. In irrigating the coastal economy, a thirty-year guano export boom would however effectively undermine state-sierra relations and Creole attention to the hinterlands, facilitating the rise of a regional caudillismo. Despite the liberal republican discourse fuelling a modernising drive, Indians were routinely contained along established lines of ""paternalistic exploitation"", the contradictions of which would come to enhance their political consciousness and inspire salient instances of revolt.

A statistical survey in 1971 demonstrated the potential scope of insider dealing.

BAWE,BAWE_106,In what senses was there a commercial revolution in the thirteenth century?,"In the thirteenth century there was undoubtedly an immeasurable increase in commercial activity. Trade with the East flourished and as did that within Europe. This was brought about with such developments as the establishment of a banking system with a fundamentally different and adequate system of book keeping and re-development of the infrastructure necessary for vast amounts of goods to travel through Europe. There is much evidence, although not quantitive, such as the increased social status of the merchant and banker and the rapidly expanding nature of commercial ports and towns such as Venice. However, the extent to which this all occurred in the thirteenth century alone is questionable. Many of the roots for such an explosion of trade lay in earlier centuries, for example by 1200 many Italian bankers had extended their role from money changers, entering the field of banking proper.

In order to address the question appropriately, it is, of course, necessary first to define the term Orientalism and therefore give a brief description of the expression and its origins. William D. Hart summarizes Orientalism as 'a Western style of domination and authority, through which the Orient is restructured'. A noticeable change in Orientalism is from where ideas have tended to generate. Initially, France and Britain were at the forefront of the movement but since World War II, America has led the way. However, perceptions are still based on Oriental assumptions. Films, television and modern media have reinforced Oriental ideas, while there are very few literary references to Orientals leading to a dehumanized perception of Orientals. Finally, the influence of American culture may have even intensified Orientalism. One could even argue that the Orient is Orientalizing itself! The essay will, therefore, come to the conclusion that popular Western understandings of Asia are still almost exclusively framed within the narrow parameters of the ideas of Orientalism. <fnote>William D.

With the benefit of hindsight, events such as the Industrial Revolution have contributed to a Eurocentric opinion of western superiority, at least until the development of modern North America. However, in the year 1300 this was not the case as in actual fact East Asia possessed a more advanced society than anywhere in the West. During the early modern period, Asian technological and agricultural innovations were envied by Europe, for at this point Europe was no more likely than East Asia to experience an industrialisation process. The economic divergence between East and West has been greatly researched, with historians providing explanations ranging from inherent climatic differences and oppressive state politics to trade and the advantages of European territorial expansion in order to explain East Asia's lack of economic progress compared to Europe.

My main argument is that the concept of 'utopian realism' is both theoretically unsound and practically unfeasible because it continuously struggles to make its utopian visions fit into the realist paradigm. I elucidate this struggle through a close examination of the four main propositions made by Booth's 'utopian realism'. After establishing the unfeasibility of the concept in the realist paradigm, I move on to examine if Booth's application of Nye's idea of ""process-utopias"" (Booth 1991, p. 536) could be used to catalyse a paradigm-shift required to make 'utopian realism' a feasible IR concept. Finally I conclude that while no paradigm-shift is possible, the concept of 'utopian realism' remains unfeasible and must therefore be abandoned.

Pettitt (Pettitt 2002), in his book The Neanderthal Dead, states that the majority of scholars would agree that some of the Neanderthal skeletons that have been found went through a burial process. He also states that generalisations are made that consist of sweeping statements such as 'they did bury their dead' (Pettitt 2002:1) which are not necessarily useful or completely accurate. There is a range of convincing burial sites which have mainly been found across the European area of the Neanderthal world - most of these have been brought into questioned as to whether they are actual burial sites. I am going to analyse three of the most convincing demonstrations of deliberate burial. The first example I am going to look at is the Iraqi Shanidar cave, then the Uzbekistani Teshik Tash and finally the French La Ferrassie cave. I will then outline some arguments against Neanderthal burial and the opposition to these arguments. The Shanidar cave-excavated between 1953-60, by Ralph Solecki-...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_736,We should treat all trivial things in life very seriously and all the serious things of life with sincere and studied triviality With reference to at least two Wilde texts discuss the way in which he uses this idea in his writing,"Oscar Wilde described this absurd quote as a philosophy, and to some extent it is a philosophy by which much of his literature exists. He raises this simple ploy to an almost ludicrous level in the construction of his social comedies. In so doing he parodies high society, portraying it as obsessed with trivia, to such an extent that it can no longer recognise the serious things in life. Wilde uses the idea to discuss not only major issues such as love and religion but also the topical ones of his time. In some ways the theme of trivialising the serious and vice versa can be attributed to the decadence of the period, which so fascinated Wilde. His works encapsulate many features of the movement, such as perversity, which was considered to be an element of the fin-de-siecle. This is apparent in numerous paradoxical statements and the manner in which characters are so fickle, constantly changing their minds over issues as serious as marriage. He satirizes men by demonstrating that they can be as perverse as women. The egoism associated with decadence contributes to the comedy with absurd confusions in priorities, such as the importance of the name 'Ernest' in...",You are a university student.

The armchair anthropologists in the Victorian era and well into the nineteenth century depended on reports from travellers, colonial officials and missionaries, these were often misleading and only conveyed a partial picture. It was from the humble ponderings of Evolutionism, the Victorian era's legacy to anthropology, that nineteenth century anthropologists gleaned the basis for their ideas. The anthropologists of the twentieth century attempted a more active approach, by moving away from the genre of armchair anthropology by establishing fieldwork led by Malinowski.

Introduction </heading>Language play, the apparently purposeless use of language in a playful manner, has until recently been sidelined in linguistic studies. But David Crystal in 1998 and Guy Cook in 2000 demonstrated how pervasive this use of language is, among children and adults, and cross-culturally. Cook points to the importance of language play in the development and exercise of social and cultural skills, and has developed a list of criteria that help to define a genre as a form of language play. This essay will analyse an adult genre of playful language use, the limerick, in relation to Cook's definition guidelines. In Crystal's view, limericks are ""a perfect example of the way sounds and spellings interact in language play"" (Crystal 1998: 45), but they contain many more linguistic, semantic and pragmatic characteristics worth of a closer investigation. The following description and analysis will show that limericks work on different, often opposite levels in order to achieve the desired effects. <heading>2.

One only has to listen to the multitudinous and compelling invocations from the top authorities on the subject in academe and the policymakers of the past, armed with the enlightenment of hindsight, to be confident that seeking to wholeheartedly engage North Korea may prove worthwhile. In an analysis of approaches toward the crisis it is important to look at how crucial events in recent years have unfolded, how policymakers have managed them, and how they have been conceptualised by erudite observers. Almost without exception in the latter case there is a belief that the essential security fears of the D.P.R.K regime have been neglected and thus the crisis continues. Even pessimistic assessments assert that some form of engagement is superior to a policy of coercion or neglect which will simply force the Kim regime to take more desperate measures to survive. North Korea must be made to feel that incentives are more advantageous than coercive bargaining, which will potentially jeopardise its relatively propitious position.

I will explain why I believe that, despite controversy, qualitative methods can be valid and reliable whilst highlighting the care psychologists need to take to use them affectively. I will conclude by explaining how qualitative methods can best be used in psychological research. Burt and Oaksford* (1999) say scientific research involves experimentation to test a hypothesis. However, whilst in long-established physical sciences such as chemistry, 'the depth of knowledge from past theorising constrains the choice of sensible hypotheses,' psychology remains a relatively 'new' science (Burt & Oaksford*, 1999). They argue that qualitative methods are essential when generating hypothesis for research in new fields, which we are interested in but unsure which questions to ask. Without them, we could only resort to an 'armchair technique'; reading limited existing literature, then 'sitting around' waiting for a hypothesis to strike you (Burt & Oaksford*, 1999). As a practical example, Abaunza et al (2005) used a grounded approach in a longitudinal study on 'the social mechanisms that encourage and discourage the uptake of smoking' (2005, p.397) in young people.

Whilst proponents of globalization claim that the phenomenon increases worldwide equality by liberalizing trade, allowing all citizens access to a global market and creating a worldwide 'family' of social and cultural interconnectedness, many others resist globalization on the grounds that it undermines state sovereignty or that it exacerbates income differentials and culture loss within societies. But what really is globalization? The process is generally understood as a reduction in the importance of national boundaries at all levels of socio-economic life; as put by Anthony Giddens, however, ""there are few terms that we use so frequently but which are in fact as poorly conceptualized as globalization.""

Its fate was perhaps sealed in 1858 by the Medical (Registration) Act, which enforced that all practitioners must be ""legally or duly qualified"" (Witz, 1992, p.73). In future all medical practitioners would have to possess what were deemed to be the necessary education and examinations in order to operate legitimately and legally. Sadly for women, this Act was also the peak of their increasing exclusion from medicine. It placed a legal barrier in the path of any woman wishing to practice, because none of the nineteen possible routes of entry into the medical register possessed examinations in which women were allowed to participate. Thus, in basic terms, the professionalisation of medicine was also its masculinisation. This masculinisation of medicine cannot and should not be seen in isolation. It reflects but also perhaps aided the dominant ideology of the time which, in being influenced by 'enlightened' thinking, saw the female gender as irrational and irresponsible, ruled by passions and emotion.

The present landscape is made up of a variety of habitats. As well as woodland, there are also those created by Man, including moorlands (especially on the uplands), heathlands and grasslands. These are 'plagioclimatic communities', habitats that have been arrested a particular stage of succession, and are maintained under various forms of management pressure such as burning and grazing. Grazing comes in many forms. The major grazing animals of Britain today are cattle, ponies, sheep, deer, and rabbits. The main effects by herbivores are grazing, trampling, elimination and nutrient input. Grazers vary in what vegetation they eat and how. Sheep are able to crop the grass to a very small height (mm) due to their jaw and teeth structure, whereas cattle tear grass with their tongues. Ponies also crop the grass to a short height but are important in nutrient cycling of an area (Putman et al., 1989).

BAWE,BAWE_784,Discuss the Processes that affect gene frequencies in a population and result in evolutionary change,"FORMULA Evolutionary theory tries to determine genotypic frequencies in populations and change through time, past, present and future. A variety of evolutionary mechanisms and forces have been classified by geneticists that affect the frequency of alternative genotypes in populations from one generation to the next. The most important of these evolutionary processes that also govern our variation are sexual reproduction, natural selection, genetic drift, mutation and recombination. Many ecological and other adaptive pressures also have affects on the exchange of genetic material between populations. All genetic evolutionary theory is based on the principles of Mendelian genetics discovered by the Silesian monk, Gregor Mendel. Mendel using experiments with peas, with differing physical characteristics such skin colour and wrinkled skin discovered the foundational laws of all genetics, based on what would be alleles operating at a single locus on a chromosome. He determined a distinction between genotype and phenotype, the genotype having two alleles or genes, in most cases on being 'dominant' and expressed and the other being 'recessive' hidden. Therefore, possible combinations of genes (if two alleles acting at single locus) determining genotype could be classified as two homozygous and one heterozygous, further leading to two phenotypes (if dominant, recessive), physically...",You are a university student.

The mere presence of it within our homes be it, mud from a shoe on a once pristinely white carpet or something less obvious such as a sock on the kitchen table often leaves the observer with feelings of anguish at its inappropriate positioning. Quite often, it seems that dirt can be allied with things associated with the outside world being brought in doors, in this common case the indoors is subsequently polluted as a result of the offending object. In an alternative situation, roles may be reversed whereby an object from 'inside' finds its way outside, in this situation the likely predicament would be for the seemingly out of place object to be considered polluted and robbed of its somewhat 'pure' former status, certainly rendered inappropriate for it to return to its former home as it were. Other confusing circumstances may be of where objects that 'belong' upstairs are brought downstairs within a house, or when under garments are visible in replacement of expected over garments.

BAWE,BAWE_431,European women both challenged and supported the Empire-building project. Discuss.,"The traditional images associated with nineteenth-century colonialism are that of the heroic explorer and solider conquering uncivilised land, and subsequently of the missionary sent to 'rescue' the heathen population through the word of Christianity. One seldom associates established images of the Empire-building project with women in any respect other than as the wives of those who lived in the colonies. Yet to view Empire, and the politics surrounding it, as a wholly male 'space' is to underestimate the role played by the female population. In terms of both the 'coloniser' and the 'colonised', women played a critical role in helping to define both the purpose and the need for colonial venture. The liberation of a downtrodden and oppressed native female became an integral part of imperial rhetoric justifying the European presence. Though often indirectly, the women of the 'mother country' were part of what helped to maintain and propagate this image. European women did not all, however, play a supporting role in the politics of Empire, and some were openly critical of the policy of imposing not simply European presence but also European culture upon these little understood lands.

The movement looked back to the superior aspects of ancient times and integrated them with the new developments of the time. The Italian Renaissance is generally associated with the fifteenth century. This period, however, can be stretched in either direction. For example, the term ""Renaissance"" has been used to describe some thirteenth-century artists, and the great artists of the Renaissance were active until the end of the sixteenth century. The rebirth of the visual arts was one aspect of the Renaissance but the development of humanism and the classical studies of the universities were as important. There were also advancements in music, literature, science and government practices during this period. How far Florence was responsible for these developments can be debated. Robert Black asserts that 'the elitism of Florentine society and the monopoly which the Florentine patriciate had over classical culture made Florence the first and greatest capital of the Renaissance'.

Recently, however, these rigidly demarcated ontological positions have been challenged by the emergence of Realism and Structuration Theory. This essay is concerned with assessing the strengths and weaknesses of Individualism and Collectivism; the main issue under consideration is how far these opposing ontologies disprove each other. This essay will argue that neither of these ontologies sufficiently describes or explains the complexity of social reality, and it is because of their deficiencies that I have been persuaded to adopt a Realist perspective. This argument will be pursued by outlining the debate between Nicos Poulantzas and Ralph Miliband concerning who or what constitutes the 'Ruling Class', in order to show how I was first alerted to the stratified nature of social realty. It will then be discussed how Collectivism successfully discredits the methodological premises of Individualism, yet does not constitute a comprehensive ontological alternative.

Often, a male character will perform irrational acts for inexplicable reasons, and is labelled ""mad"" or ""beyond reason"" when social comprehension of his actions is bewildered. Attic theatre has ""two nouns for madness, both feminine, both daemonically personified: Ate and Lyssa."" (Padel 162) Both are external forces that work their influence upon the male interior. Though women are the frequent victims of madness in both the Oresteia and Bacchae, the consequences of female insanity are always rendered as ancillary to those inflicted on the male or the social hegemonies they personify. Men such as Agamemnon and Pentheus, bloated with hubris, have fallible judgement. Irrationality in such characters catalyses their destruction. Madness in females will always have tragic consequences for the women involved, yet it is always celestially ordained; a manifestation either of prophetic destiny or divine wrath directed overwhelmingly at the heroic male. Women are the active agents of a hero's demise: the consequences of feminine madness are frequently violent and always emasculative. They work to dismantle male power structures.

Orwell believed that the most important and effective tool in upholding social order is through the regulation of language. Two novels that encapsulate the fears of how a totalitarian society can use language as a method of control over the people within it are his two last works, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. These novels, in which Orwell established his popularity and reputation, provoked divided opinions, radical ideas and cultural unease at a time when many people were filled with anxieties and uncertainties about how authorities would govern their countries after the World War Two. After the allegorical reflection of Joseph Stalin's tyrannical rule over the Soviet Union which was witnessed in Animal Farm, Orwell further attacked the idea of totalitarian authorities in Nineteen Eighty-Four, by portraying a world just thirty six years into the future where advanced technology gives absolute political authority to those in charge.

BAWE,BAWE_799,Exploring the role of violence in selected contemporary Latin American cinema,"Scenes of violence are relatively common in film, and contemporary Latin American cinema is no exception. However, the type and grade of violence, and the context in which it is portrayed, differ significantly from one film to the next. It is therefore useful - and arguably necessary - to examine each expression of violence on its own merits and in the context of the film in order to really understand what purpose it serves. Several questions stand out as central to this analysis: What manifestations of violence are shown? How is it used by directors/writers? What effect does the violence have on the viewer? How does it contribute to our understanding of the film's story and characters? How, if at all, does the portrayal of violence in contemporary cinema reflect the realities of modern Latin American society? What societal values/views do the films expose regarding violence?

The fundamentally different approaches taken by Descartes and Hume make the conclusions that each reach only applicable to the individual projects undertaken.

Hume's scepticism is also at fault at concerning the methods he uses to doubt such as his ideas of reducing probabilities and his subscribtion to the notion of sense datum. Descartes methods of casting doubt onto both the senses and reason are more plausible. Hume's scepticism is based on an idea that it is not possible to have certain knowledge and that as such, all our cases of knowledge are probabilities. I would deny that these probabilities always reduce to zero due to human fallibility and that this fault fundamentally undermines Hume's scepticism.

The ebb and flow of forces that can be broadly categorised as separatist or royalist results in a back-and-forth struggle that cannot be used as evidence for the ascendancy of momentum or the inevitability of victory for independence, as the example of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, under Spain until the 1898 Spanish-American War, testifies.

The nation's enduring myths came to laud the opportunities available to the individual, who through sustained hard work and self-reliance could achieve status and position through the attainment of wealth. Mainstream society founded itself on the rudimentary belief that without Old World systems of government and class structure, for its white population at least, the republic would offer no impediment to social and economic reward through personal focus and development. Literature certainly bolstered and promoted such values, with well-circulated early texts such as Benjamin Franklin's autobiography propagating personal testaments to the abundance of opportunities available to the U.S. citizen. Accordingly, particular well-defined notions pertaining to these goals established themselves firmly in the American consciousness.

Some parents of these children took the education authorities to court to prevent their children being labelled as 'retarded' (Fancher, 1985). This raised the question of whether it is correct to test intelligence, if the outcome produces more harm than good. In fact some states in America prohibited the testing of Black children to avoid legal battles (Fancher, 1985). When considering if it is correct to test children it is important to realise that there actually is no one definition of intelligence making it extremely difficult to devise an intelligence test. Supposing a valid and reliable test was devised the benefits for using Intelligence tests seem to be outweighed by negative outcomes.

Not recently, official statistics have been questioned as to the degree of their validity, reliability and objectivity and whether these are in fact essential. When considering whether sociologists should use official statistics one has to consider whether the limitations outweigh the advantages to using them in accordance with the researcher's theoretical perspective. Many sociologists believe there is an exaggerated suspicion of social measurement and an excessive distrust of officially produced numerical data. Most researchers that are positivist in nature need to examine the social world in an objective and scientific way and those who produce these statistics make every effort to follow the scientific canons to ensure the reliability and validity of their work.

Hillman (2001) is correct to claim that addressing the boundary between the self and the world is a fundamental core issue for psychology, if it is agreed that there is a problem in psychology which requires this to be re-addressed. If the primary purpose of psychology is to further the discipline academically then Hillman (2001) is incorrect to claim this boundary is the core issue, it should be considered as one of many issues taken into account when conducting research. Any scientific discipline ultimately requires an objective measure of its subject, which in psychology can best be conducted in a laboratory. However, if the sole purpose of psychology is seen as drawing conclusions about people's behaviour from observing them in the environment in which they live, this boundary definitely is the one core issue psychologists need to address.

BAWE,BAWE_1097,"Can punishment be justified in either purely retributive or purely consequentialist terms? If not, how can it be justified?","Given the esteem with which rights are regarded in the majority of liberal systems, it seems only natural to question the justification which lies behind what is generally regarded as a legitimate, yet can often be horrendous, violation of these rights. The two prominent theories within the justification of state punishment rely on two very different justificatory methods; the utilitarian perspective is instrumental in its approach, whilst the retributive perspective seeks justification through an appeal to the intrinsic nature of punishment. Jeremy Bentham, in his An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, expounds what is generally considered to be the most influential account of the utilitarian justifications of punishment; <quote> ""The general object which all laws have, in common, is...to exclude, as far as may be, every thing that tends to subtract from...happiness: in other words, to exclude mischief.

BAWE,BAWE_652,What is 'will' for Schopenhauer and how coherent is his account of it?,"The concept of 'will' for Schopenhauer is intended to ground the phenomenal world and set a limit to the universe. It is a metaphysical principle that Schopenhauer believes we have access to directly, unmediated by the principle of sufficient reason. The two main problems in understanding the concept of will are the epistemological question - how does Schopenhauer believe we have knowledge of the will? - and the constitutive question - what can Schopenhauer legitimately say about the will's nature? Kant's critical philosophy set out to set a limit to human knowledge; to delimit the conditions of our knowledge of the world and thereby that beyond which we can not legitimately think. For Kant, the empirical world is determined by our subjective faculties. That is to say that there are conditions set upon our experience of the world by our constitution as subjects. The world exceeds our faculties' ability to cognize however; the world as it exceeds our faculties' abilities is by definition unknowable: this Kant calls the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer's philosophy represents an attempt to give content to this thing-in-itself; consequently at first glance it appears highly paradoxical.

As Table 1 illustrates, taken from Myhill, A. and Allen, J. (2002) Home Office Research Study 237, although the number of recorded rapes has increased more than fourfold since 1985; the number of convictions has remained static. Added to this is the concern that many women do not even report the assault, so those who do are seen as the tip of the iceberg. As will shortly be illustrated, even this tip is decimated as the criminal justice system runs its course (Lees, 1997, p177). The criminal justice system at the present state gives a victim of sexual assault little hope of seeing the offender brought to justice.

BAWE,BAWE_875,How can sociology and psychology help health and social care professionals to understand the experience of health or the effects of ilness / disability / service delivery on the individual?,"When modern medicine was established in the nineteenth century it was based upon the premise that illness was caused by diseases attacking the body. Health was believed to be the absence of disease. Health care was therefore based almost entirely upon the conceptualisation of health as a biological state of being. Society as a whole and the individual in particular were believed to have little or no influence over health, illness or disability. This placed the responsibility and control over health and illness within the medical profession. This view of health has since been described as the medical model. In the twentieth century sociologists and psychologists began to challenge the medical model of health. They suggested that health is influenced by society and the individual as well as biology. Sociology and psychology explained not only the effects of society and the individual on health but through scientific studies developed theories which explained the experience of health and the effects of illness, disability and service delivery on the individual. By examining how particular theories apply to practise I will demonstrate how sociology and psychology can help the health care professional to understand the effects of illness and service delivery on the...",You are a university student.

They do not share the same starting points or very little common ground and it is especially problematic to define the 'holistic' approach embedded in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (Lowenberg and Davis 1989:587). However, the increase in the use of CAM over the past 10 years cannot be ignored (Giddins 2001:142, Zollman 2006:836) and the reasons for this increase are far from clear (Cant and Calnan 1991:40, Zollman 2006:836). To consider, therefore, the extent to which CAM can be an alternative or complementary medicine source to scientific medicine is far from easy. In this essay I will briefly describe both 'scientific' and 'alternative' and 'complementary' medicines.(1) My arguments will focus on three areas. Firstly, CAM operates on a much less hierarchical method than the biomedical model and can therefore provide a contrasting alternative structure for the provision of health care, although this may be impossible to accommodate it within the NHS structure (Sharma 1992:3). Secondly, CAM encourages patient participation (Sharma 1995:41), as opposed to the biomedical model where the patient is the passive recipient (Aakster 1986:268) and can therefore offer a considerably different consultation system.

Modern day prejudices can effect even the simplest discussion of history. There will be a conscious attempt here to provide an ultimately objective critique of the above statement made by Eamon de Valera in 1966. A reading of recent historical work concerning these two powerful characters provides a variety of opinions. Clearly, de Valera believed that Michael Collins' life and premature death secured him quasi martyrdom and a sympathetic remembrance. He may have felt that the fighter was more likely to be idolised than the politician. However, a theme central to this essay will be the discussion of whether the portrayal of Collins as simply a revolutionary soldier and freedom fighter is especially accurate.

Would Hobbes have an answer?,"In his autobiography Hobbes dramatically writes that ""Fear and I were born as twins!"" and fear is the underlying principle of his political philosophy. It is inherent in his conception of the nature of man and from there a driving force towards the development of a political society. The political society that Hobbes aims to create, as the logical conclusion of his premises about man, is an absolute sovereignty with no restrictions on the ruler, an idea that Locke vehemently attacks in the Two Treatises. This absurdity Locke illustrates using his polecats and lions, an attack not necessarily specifically directed at Hobbes, but like much of the Treatises was an attempt to detect and overthrow 'the false principles and foundations of Sir Robert Filmer', who repeatedly contended that 'A King according to law makes no kind of government'. Hobbes, however, is the most famous exponent of the defence of the absolute monarchical tradition, most famously in Leviathan but also in De Cive and De Corpore Politico and for this reason consideration of his hypothetical response to the criticism is of the utmost importance.

In many respects Segal's opinion, supported by evidence of a declining Chinese economy; a defensive and regionally-bound military and an incompetent government lacking in ideology, are convincing in disproving China's perceived or potential world status. However, as Shaun Breslin points out: China does matter - but how and who for? The answer to this question will differ according to different theoretical approaches. Clearly, the assumption on Segal's part that international relations is the arena of superpowers and rivalry led him to conclude that China was not a terribly important country. However, the aim of this essay is to expose the importance of China through a theoretical approach which places China within a larger capitalist world order.

For James, Francois Dominique Toussaint L'Ouverture is the figure of freedom and liberty for the eighteenth century genre of slave narratives. He led the only successful slave rebellion in the colonies, against the French in Haiti in 1791. During the Romantic era, common opinions of slavery were based upon Aristotle's philosophies that ""from the hour of their birth, some men are marked out for subjection, others for rule."" It was these prejudices and overwhelming oppressions that black writers and poets had to overcome. As Davis comments ""the purported connection between the act of writing and the 'rights of man' did not escape the notice of the slave.""

BAWE,BAWE_749,No title,"From the late eighteenth until the early nineteenth century, typically known as the 'Romantic' period in the history of literature, nature was used by poets to express to reader's notions and ideas that could not be expressed in the restricted 'rational' terms of conventional forms of writing which had preceded them. This previous preoccupation with rational thought can explain why a mass of critical opinion towards Romantic poetry at the time was seen simply as nature writing. The above quotation attempts to explain that the presentation of nature in Romantic writing is dependent on how it is perceived and interpreted, the 'observing consciousness' being not only that of the writer, but also in the reader's subjective inference. With this in mind, it is easy to see from a critical perspective that a poet's 'overflowing of spontaneous emotion' (Wordsworth, 1798, 22) could have been the product of the direct influence of nature. However, this opinion views descriptions of nature in poetry as 'a principle order, of which the ordering mind is part' (Williams, 1985, 13), but what Romantic poetry typically embodied was the portrayal of nature as a 'principle of creation, of which the creative mind is a part' (13).

Mao focussed on setting grain and steel targets to boost production and moulded the existing cooperatives into a smaller number of communes. He wanted to achieve this through a process of 'walking on two legs' by combining modern, large-scale capital intensive methods with traditional, small-scale methods of production. However, despite these seemingly good intentions the Great Leap Forward was a one of the biggest failures in China's recent history and there are a number of reasons for its lack of success. One important reason to consider is how much it was solely Mao's influence and how much he personally was responsible for the Great Leap Forward's (GLF) lack of success.

BAWE,BAWE_123,It follows from the first theorem of welfare economics that the educational system would work more efficiently if schools were profit-motivated firms instead of state sector agents. Discuss.,"The First Theorem of Welfare Economics guarantees that a competitive market will exhaust all the gains from trade: an equilibrium allocation achieved by a set of competitive markets will necessarily be Pareto efficient. Under these conditions, competitive markets also lead to efficiency involving the allocation of resources over time and under uncertainty. As education is not a homogenous product, this essay first argues that in the market for tertiary and higher education, it would be more efficient for educational institutions to operate as profit-motivated firms instead of state sector agents. Nevertheless, market failure exists and equity issues are omitted in the First Theorem of Welfare Economics.

BAWE,BAWE_133,To what extent should policy be used to stabilise the economy? Discuss with examples from the UK.,"Stabilisation policy is policy undertaken by governments in an attempt to modify fluctuations in the business cycle by reducing the size of peak and troughs. Economists have differing views about the extent in which policy should be used to stabilise the economy. At one end of the spectrum are economists such as Milton Friedman who believe that government attempts to stabilise the economy can actually do more harm than good whilst at the other are those who believe that government policy is a very successful tool in economy stabilisation, for example to avoid high unemployment and inflation. In theory monetary and fiscal policy has the potential to be a very powerful tool in affecting the economy and theory suggests that it can be used by policy makers to improve macroeconomic performance. However, in practice the application of the theory is not always straightforward as issues such as macroeconomic uncertainty, lags, and credibility of government policy come into play. Within the Keynesian Fixed Price Model, monetary and fiscal policy can theoretically be used to stabilise the economy.

BAWE,BAWE_902,A Pragmatic Analysis of a script from Friends,"Sitcoms (Situational Comedies) often play with the normal codes of cooperation between people in a conversation. The way every script is constructed is carefully analysed and discussed by the writers in order to create the expected humour effect. They might not know but one of the principles that they use to achieve this is the Pragmatics one. According to Cutting (2002), Pragmatics takes a socio-cultural perspective on language usage and studies its context, text and function. Therefore, this essay will provide a pragmatic analysis on one of the scripts taken from the American sitcom Friends. First, a short introduction to the Sitcom and its characters will be presented. Then Grice's conversational maxims of the Cooperative Principle, Brown and Levinson's Politeness theory and Leech's Politeness Maxims will be summarized and then illustrated throughout the text analysis. Finally, a conclusion will be drawn on the effectiveness of these frameworks to understand the text chosen and on the peculiarities discovered about the humour used in Friends.

Discuss.,"The foundations of the group of historians now known as the Annales 'school' were laid when in 1929 Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre published the journal Annales d'histoire économique et sociale. Since this pivotal moment, the Annales have been credited with undermining the positivist definition of historical fact, destroying the taboo on unwritten evidence, imposing a dialogue with other disciplines, discrediting the history of events, and rejecting the primacy of political history. Importantly, this tradition cannot be attributed to a single historian, nor has it employed a 'clear-cut' paradigm. 'Their work is united, however, in terms of theoretical and methodological principles embodied in the journal Annales: Économies, Sociétés, Civilisations whence their name derives."" Trevor-Roper helpfully captures these elements of unity, emphasising their attempts to grasp the totality and cohesion of every historical period, their conviction that history is at least partly determined by forces which are external to man, and their determination to reduce areas of incomprehension by rigorous statistical analysis. Fernand Braudel's contribution to the Annales tradition, although significant, should be therefore, placed within a wider tradition of conjectural fluidity and development.

Associations act to maintain democracy once it had emerged, especially resolving the initial problem of isolationism, which Tocqueville considers inherent in the transition to democracy. Moreover, associations play an essential role in encouraging and nurturing political participation in society through the collective activity, whilst maintaining the identity and importance of the individual.

Consider how research in cognitive development could help you decide which concepts were taught and when.,"Science is a key subject taught in primary schools today as part of the National Curriculum. Teachers draw upon the National Curriculum for guidance about what scientific concepts should be taught and to what age group they should be aimed at. In order to provide teachers with appropriate guidance, developers of curricula can refer to empirical evidence and theories about cognitive development. One of the first major theories of cognitive development was devised by Piaget. He saw development as taking place in four stages; the sensorimotor stage, the preoperational stage, the concrete operational stage and the formal operational stage (Harris & Butterworth, 2002). Piaget devised tests to determine what stage particular children were in. These tests included assessing children's knowledge of specific scientific concepts. Many later experiments, however, contradicted Piaget's findings, as will be discussed later, and other theories of cognitive development were proposed, including that of Vygotsky and the information-processing approach. Piaget's theory has been directly applied to the equivalent to the national curriculum in America (Good, 1977) and there have been consistent findings that children are taught concepts far in advance of what Piaget would suggest for their age group.

Having described the differences I will move on to the reasons suggested for these and look at the three main arguments suggested; difference theory, deficiency theory and dominance theory before arguing that these theories tend to be too constricted in their scope and that gender is simply part of a wider theory of language differences, that of accommodation. Different use of language for reasons of sex and gender are often placed into two categories, sex-exclusive differences and sex-preferential differences. Differences which are used exclusively by one sex or the other nearly all of the time are sex-exclusive differences whereas sex-preferential differences are those which are slightly less concrete in their usage and are more a question of frequency of usage.

Both reveal great deals of useful information, however there are remaining unanswered questions and limitations to deal with. The study of the Roman economy is necessary as it can explain many social aspects such as urbanisation, agriculture, technological advances and so on (Greene 1992: 13). Investigation has resulted in two main schools of thought concerning the state of the economy. One group, including the historian Rostovtzeff, claim the economy was actually much like that experienced in the Western world today. The second, led by Finley and Jones, suggests that it was much more humble. Agriculture was at its centre and towns never developed into large-scale industrial areas financed by trade (Greene 1992: 14). Firstly considering samian ware, for a long time it appears that because of the general abundance of pottery, the area seems to have been disregarded compared to others linked to economic factors.

Although this adaptation would probably have included subsistence strategies, this paper will focus on the possibility of skeletal morphology. Neanderthal anatomy and the reason or purpose for such unusual characteristics has been the subject of debate since the initial find in the Neander Valley in Germany in 1856. Original propositions included the possibility of deformity but quickly altered to climatic adaptation through skeletal morphology.

Nelson Rockefeller says they must be able, ""to lead, to persuade, to inspire trust, to attract men of talent, to unite"". To do this, he appears to demand every talent somebody could possibly have to be concentrated in one person. However, the problem is that the constitution grants the president very weak powers, and certainly not enough to fulfil the incredible expectations heaped upon them. Instead, the real power of the president comes from extra-constitutional powers that have evolved over time as well as informal powers that the president alone is in a position to exploit. Yet, the effectiveness that can be extracted from these powers are not constant, and vary with the differing circumstances that every president must face; a foreign or domestic crisis, the make up of Congress, the death of a Supreme Court justice, amongst other problems, can all increase, and decrease, a presidents power.

She was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Germany in the beginning of the 20 th century. Exhibiting a strong passion and sensitive insight into intellectual activities at an early age, she studied philosophy under two most influential modern philosophers, Jaspers and Heidegger. During World War II, being a Jewish woman, she suffered from Nazi-German's anti-Semitism and was once sent into prison for a short time. She managed to escape to the States in 1941 and spent the rest of her life there. These life experiences have unavoidably diverted her attention from pure theoretical and philosophical activities to practical area of politics. In The Origins of Totalitarianism and Eichmann in Jerusalem, Arendt answered the puzzling question, for all those who suffered and survived World War II, how is totalitarian domination and evil of both Nazism and Stalinism possible in the modern age. Without doubt is Arendt a great writer with extraordinary literary talent. Unlike most of the German scholars, her style is articulate, imaginative and passionate.

This is important because it implies that there are different factors that affect the way people speak, and that there is a variety of language used among people in society.

Also, if there is linguistic variation between gender and class. Gender refers to the social, cultural and psychological differences that occur between men and women. It should not be confused with sex, which is associated with the biological and anatomical differences between men and women.

Since then, unions have been upheld as the traditional promoters of justice and fairness at the workplace. Trade union membership experienced a meteoric rise from late 1968 to 1979(Blyton and Turnbull, 2004, p.139) However from 1979 till date unionism has been declining progressively. The steady and continuous disintegration of collective organization in British workplaces since 1979 in terms of union membership, union density and collective bargaining coverage has been remarkable. Union membership shattered from its peak at 12.6 million in 1979 to 7.1 million in 1998, a significant reduction in membership density of the employed workforce from 56% to 30%.( Terry, 2003,p.459).

Different cultures and even the individual communities within them have their own unique and distinct way of thinking and behaving; therefore, as a child learns about other people's mannerisms they also discover elements of their own mind (Gopnik et al., 1999) and the appropriate ways of behaving in different situations.

This essay will outline different dispersal strategies and discuss the various hypotheses that have been put forward to explain why primates disperse. It will focus specifically on three different examples of dispersal types, female-biased dispersal in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), male-biased dispersal in East African vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and both-sex dispersal in red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus), but touch on other examples where relevant.

There are also government agencies, quangos and non-departmental public bodies e.g. Arts Council of England, Sports Council, National Park Authorities. The government works with and through these to provide for recreation. They assist with planning, provision and management. The local authority has a large input into leisure provision - in 1985/6 local government spent £1882 million under the revenue budget headings of recreation and leisure [Haywood, 2002.] The local authority provides some facilities for general public use e.g. swimming pools, libraries.

If not, why not?","<heading>Introduction</heading>This paper addresses one of the fundamental objections to Naturalist Moral Realism (NMR). The argument runs that NMR moral judgements do not cohere with practicality requirement of morality and Humean picture of beliefs and desires. The first part of the essay explains the nature of the problem and a possible solution, as argued for by Michael Smith in his book Moral Problem. An important role in this plays his analysis of normative reasons. The second part of the essay evaluates Smith's solution in reference to Brink's and Copp's papers. They try to challenge Smith in various ways. I consider four, in my opinion most influential, counter-arguments. These arguments challenge Smith's analysis of normative reasons; in particular, it seems to ignore a fundamental level of human cognition. Moreover, they question the connection between moral judgements and motivation he defends and the definition of 'full rationality', which he provides. If Smith succeeds in making a link between moral facts and beliefs about normative reasons, and showing that normative reasons and rationality can be beyond reasonable doubt shown to affect how people are motivated to act, we can say that it possible to be a naturalist moral realist without denying that there is...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_100,"If the Way of Truth is true, why does Parmenides write the Way of Seeming?","Parmenides' contribution to the philosophical canon is in the form of a poem which, for ease of reference, is divided into three parts. The introduction presents Parmenides as a shaman of sorts, and is sometimes considered the more literary prelude to the philosophical thoughts which occur in the following parts. The Way of Truth follows on from the introduction, and in it the goddess reveals that the world is unchanging, in spite of what evidence our senses might provide to the contrary. The goddess is able to see past our sensory picture of the world because she is speaking as one who has a viewpoint completely detached from the world of mortals. After communicating this divine revelation, repeatedly stressing that it is the only true way, she then takes what appears an odd step in her reasoning, describing the world as mortals perceive it. This is the Way of Seeming, which the goddess has condemned as being entirely erroneous. The central question, then, is this: why reveal the truth about reality and then follow it with a description of what mortals wrongly believe to be true?

This meant that ancient doctors would have taken their observations on what happened on the outside of the patient's body and they were expected to use these 'in order to determine what was happening inside' the body.

Some scholars believe that Ranke has been misunderstood by many and that his impact has been manipulated to serve specific purposes. This essay will attempt to unmask the true essence of Ranke's historical philosophy in order to discover his relationship with scientific history. In light of this it will become possible to conclude whether or not he can be accurately described as 'the father of scientific history'. Certainly, Ranke's methodology was riddled with scientific precision. He was utterly convinced of the need to consult primary texts as sources; these were the embodiment of historical truth. Having trawled through the archives the historian's next task according to him was to corroborate and compose a critique of the evidence at hand. Above all, given the nature of Ranke's chosen field - the history of the nation state - the most useful data were the official documents of European statesmen.

BAWE,BAWE_298,'The people had no role to play in politics'. Discuss.,"Although the role of the people within politics has long been assessed and discussed, a consensus has failed to emerge, with much of the debate still centring upon the concept of 'politics'. With few formal and representative institutions during the early modern period, formal political participation of the people can be seen to have been minimal, seemingly reinforcing the assertion that they had no role to play in politics. Such an assertion however, can be seen to neglect recent scholarship, which suggests a less polar division between the people and politics, with a greater emphasis placed upon community involvement and the persist acts of resistance and rebellion. In order to then assess the role of the people in politics, we need to consider both the formal and informal ways in which the people participated. Most importantly we need to define the concept of 'politics', as our assessment ultimately rests upon its interpretation. Furthermore we need to consider the lack of homogeneity within the period. Divisions and differences can be found between as well as within composite states and kingdoms, making any over arching assessment problematic and difficult.

From an ethologist view point Bowlby emphasised not only details about causation and development of behaviour, but also its evolutionary properties. These include a human infants dependence on their caregivers for warmth, shelter, protection and food, hence they have the innate need to form an attachment to their caregiver. From the social approach, Bowlby considers children as part of the network of social relationships and hence places emphasis on all individuals concerned in the relationship (children, parents, peers amongst others) (Vasta, 1997). Bowlby identified two main issues upon which he based his research, firstly he found that a high proportion of youths who were treated for behavioural problems had had a disruptive relationship with their mothers in their childhood - it is from this that Bowlby developed his maternal deprivation hypothesis (Vasta, 1997).

More recently however, the actions of humans during this prehistoric period have been thought to play a vital role (Behre 1986). The soils of any given area have proved to be very important for agricultural communities throughout history and pre-history. The exploitation of the soils that has taken place has a huge effect upon the soils of Great Britain now and has throughout time (Thomas 1990). Direct and indirect evidence such as pollen diagrams, aerial photographs, geophysical surveys and chemical soil analysis can be used to suggest ways in which the soils have been exploited in the past. Soils have been used to show patterns of prehistoric agricultural development by interpreting the formation process of soils in archaeological sites (Wilshusen and Stone 1990). Due to the importance of archaeology in the quest to find the effects of prehistoric Man on present-day soils and the importance of soils, in any study of prehistoric settlement, a great deal of agriculture involves pedology or the study of soils in their natural setting (Wilshusen and Stone 1990).

Slavery and race are closely connected in both films. However, both films have different approaches to the topics, with Spartacus offering a political view of slavery and race, whereas Gladiator primarily uses slavery and race to create a setting for the film and does not create as significant a political statement. This essay will discuss and examine the role of slavery and race as themes in both Spartacus and Gladiator, focussing mainly on particular scenes, but also investigating methods used by the directors and the importance of various characters. Spartacus was released in 1960, directed by Stanley Kubrick, and followed Spartacus, a Thracian slave, as he led a slave revolt against the Roman Republic. Unsurprisingly, considering the plotline of the film, Spartacus has slavery and freedom as its main themes.

It is necessary to start with a definition of diplomacy where we distinguish between the actors, the functions and the agenda of diplomacy. Then we proceed with a short description of Cold war diplomacy, as this will also provide us with a theoretical background for further arguments and comparison. An analysis of the evolution of diplomacy thus relies on aspects identified by the definition and aims to elucidate to what extent changes have occurred. The paper discusses changes in diplomatic actors, developments of multilateral and regional diplomacy, evolution of personal diplomacy and public diplomacy, and the shifts in agenda of diplomacy. The most important development occurred in emergence of new actors, new style of diplomacy and evolution of new multilateral agenda. It seems that the major change is the emergence of transnational diplomacy.

To assume that the loss of European transit trade was a key factor in the decline is an assumption tainted by an orientalist discourse. More pressing causes for the withering away of the Ottoman state were the incompetence of the Ottoman administration to adapt to changing conditions. Hence, the decline should be attributed to incompetent administrative and economic policies. In addition, failed military adventures contributed to an ever declining central authority. The Dutch Vice-Consul de Willem in Aleppo aptly summarizes this argument - ""it is not just one pillar that is broken or weakened, but all four pillars of State: religion, justice, politics and finances."" Therefore, to assume that external trade was a major aspect of its decline lends too great of an emphasis to the impact of European trade and the underlying orientalist assumptions.

Tense and syntax are two such areas of study and the aim of this assignment is to look at whether tense is in fact a matter of syntax. Tense is described as 'a particular set of inflectional affixes that communicate information about the time frame in which something exists or occurs'. (Berk, 1999:98). It is concerned with locating events and situations at particular points along a time line and therefore the grammatical markings which are found on verbs are present in order to indicate 'time reference relative to either the time of speaking or the time at which some other situation was in force'. (Jacobs, 1995) In the English language there are only two marked tenses, the past and the present and these are distinguished by the inflections which are added to the verbs; past is generally marked with an '-ed' ending and the present marked with an '-s' suffix in the case of third person singular forms.

Descartes justified this claim by asserting that by definition, God was a supremely perfect being, and that existence was a quality that was necessary of such a perfect being. According to Descartes, all the infinite perfections formed a coherent and undeniable unity in any notion of God. However, one of the objections to the Ontological argument was that 'exist' is not a predicate. Since Immanuel Kant, proponents of this notion have argued that existence is not a property of objects and could not be regarded as a feature they can possess. If this belief is true, it would have to be conceded that existence can no longer be ascribed to any notion of God as part of the description of him because existence would cease to be a perfection to be unified necessarily with the other perfections in the idea of God. Defenders of the ontological argument were now challenged by this objection to put forward contrary arguments.

BAWE,BAWE_917,Economic Essay,"Elasticity is a measure of responsiveness. The price elasticity of demand is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price. One way to measure responsiveness is by using the slope of demand curve (Slope = change in y-axis / change in x-axis). We want to know the change in quantity that results from a £1 change in price. As slope of demand curve is always negative, we are commonly interested in the inverse of the slope. However, there are problems by using slope to measure responsiveness. We cannot compare two demand curves simply by their slopes because the slope of a demand curve depends in the nits in which we measure the price and quantity. We also need to compare the demand curves for various goods but different goods have different units. On the other hand, prices vary greatly. A £1 change in the price of an expensive good produce a small response but £1 change in the price of a cheap good produce a large response. As a result, we have to use another way to measure responsiveness and elasticity is that measure. Price elasticity of demand (η) is...",You are a university student.

The tension between order and justice represented in his work marks a sophisticated interpretation of one of the perennial conundrums that belies international politics. Bull conceived of order as the best way to ensure basic justice, that is the minimal justice required to protect the core values of social existence. He chose neither the extremes of realism nor revolutionism that subordinated justice for order or vice versa and employed the criticisms of each tradition to deconstruct the excesses of the other. The Anarchical Society was his principal work and it is a paragon of state centric analysis of international relations that is not bound by rigid positivism. Bull constructed a theory that maintained that, within an international system in which anarchy pertained, order among states was vital and best served by the system of international society. It is in this way, by presenting order and justice in tension - a result of the pluralist and solidarist elements of his theory - that Bull opens the door for critical theory. Bull defended international society as the ultimate political organisation in a state system...","You are a university student.

The main question in this conflict between smokers and non-smokers is whether the ban should only include restaurants and bars where food is being served or whether it should also be expanded to pubs and nightclubs (Loreck 2006). Another disputed point of the smoking ban are its positive and negative effects on the economy. However, many countries around the globe have already a city- or countrywide ban, others like England and France will become smoke-free in 2007 (Kielinger 2006). Therefore, this essay will first consider reasons that reject the ban and it will then explain some of the problems with this view. Afterwards, it will provide arguments in order to demonstrate that a smoking ban for all enclosed public places should be introduced in Germany. It is the contention of smoking-supporters that the ban in Germany should not include pubs and nightclubs, because there, no food is being served and teenager under the age of 16 are not allowed to go there.

Before this period Scandinavia was a distant outpost with little cultural, political and economic significance or value for the rest of the world. The beginning of the Viking age starts traditionally around 793 AD to when the first historical account of a Viking raid was writted describing a raid on an English monastery at Lindisfarne on the east coast. It is around this time that similar records of raids start appearing all around Europe. The age of the Vikings had begun. The popular image of the Vikings handed down through the generations is based on written accounts from the time. These accounts portray them as brutal, merciless barbarians who were nothing more than heathen pagans that spent their lives killing and stealing from good Christian folk. In many respects this image was true to a certain degree but it must be taken into account who wrote these depictions.

This is largely due to the fact that the formation of common policy on employment matters at European level signifies a formally acknowledged wish for the countries - members of EU to streamline their efforts towards the achievement of coordinated results in the social dimension of their activity. As Jacobsson puts it, 'traditional welfare policy areas, such as employment policy and social protection, have recently been defined as areas of 'common concern' among the EU member states and are no longer exclusively a national responsibility' (2004:357). It is clear that regulations at supranational level became necessary to ensure that European social policy does not fall too much behind the more developed economic one and that the compliance with common rules was established. In addition, Jacobsson (2004:357) points out that the inability of pre-EES employment policies to 'effectively reduce unemployment increased the willingness of member states to consider coordinated action and voluntary convergence of labour market policies.'

What goes on in the USA does not only affect the domestic economy but influences almost all economies in the world. Following a decade marked by the longest US expansion on record, the US economy slipped into recession in early 2001.

However, that is not to say that text is inert, that it is incapable of providing a means from which to create a sense of meaning within an individual. By allowing a fictitious environment to inhabit our realm of conscious thought, we are able to comprehend a perspective and sense of reality outside of our own. Therefore it can be seen that an individual's engagement with a text can be more of a subjective experience than an objective one. It is not possible to understand another individual if one cannot at the same time identify oneself with them. If a reader associates their self with a character in a work of fiction whom it is believed the messages or ideas of the text are being conveyed to, they in return may use the insight gained from the text to put into perspective their own personal context, hence a story is developed far beyond what is merely implied in the text.

In forced migration these 'strangers' arrive seeking safe haven, and particularly in cases of sudden mass influxes, place burdens and strains on the receiving host state. The Preamble of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (hereafter the '1951 Convention') acknowledges that ""the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries,"" and hence ""a satisfactory solution of a problem of which the United Nations has recognized the international scope and nature cannot therefore achieved without international co-operation."" This short statement raises a myriad number of questions such as what does it mean to have an 'unduly heavy burden'? What is the threshold of such a burden?

There were many reasons to go into battle, for the salvation of your people, the respect of your men, and for your own personal glory. These can be divided in to two sections, a culture of shame, and a culture of guilt. In a shame culture you fought for the glory others would heap upon you, and for the contempt they would feel for you if you were too cowardly to fight. A guilt culture is one in which you fought for your own morals and beliefs, in the knowledge that you would not be able to bear yourself if you did not stand up to the challenge of battle.

BAWE,BAWE_6,Outline the social and political factors that led to the development of feminism in Japan,"The development of feminist thought and action in Japan is distinct from that of its emergence in the West, more specifically within the United States and Britain. Though influenced by Western politics, the development of feminism in Japan was also initiated by numerous other social and political factors that affected the political climate at that specific time and place. Adherence to Confucian ideologies severely restricted women within Japanese society, as well as subordinating the working classes and those not owning property. A growing political awareness and imperialist competition later led to the struggle for social reform, of which women were arguably at the forefront. This essay will deal with such social and political factors as these to account for the development of feminism in Japan. The subordinate position of women within Japanese society came to be highlighted at the end of the nineteenth century, whereas previously notions of the 'natural inferiority of women'1 had been largely unchallenged. This had implications for the rights of women concerning property, marriage and divorce, amongst other issues. Adopting Chinese Confucian ethics, the Japanese sought to uphold and promote to younger generations the established patriarchy through regulating the autonomy and independence of women.

During this time, some trends in the ways children are raised have undergone changes; from employing a full time nanny in rich Victorian households, to leaving children in a crèche during the world wars, to mothers leaving work to look after their children full time. The derogatory effects of foisting ones children upon a stranger were of great pertinence after the Second World War, which, in part, prompted the commission of John Bowlby's 'Childcare and the growth of love'. The manner in which infants form relationships with their main caregiver, known as attachment theory, was first advanced by John Bowlby in 1951. For 20 years, Bowlby ran a weekly mother's group at a local clinic, where he made informal observations of a random sample of babies and young children interacting with their mothers. Attachment theory has enabled the clinician to attend to attachment experiences in their own right, not as displacements or derivatives of other motives (Parkes et al., 1991).

Were the railways more important than the canals or the turnpike trusts?,"Between 1750 and 1860, the cost of transport in Britain was reduced strikingly due to a series of innovations. For example in road transport, the evolution of the turnpike trusts in the early part of the seventeenth century provides a large part of the reason for lower land transport charges in the 1750s than at the beginning of the century. These decreases in transport costs had a big impact on the British economy at the time, so much so that if these innovations had never taken place, the economy would have required a substantial grant of free resources to compensate for their absence. Hence to analyse the direct effects of cost reduction we must look to the Social Savings of transport. Consequently in this essay I will evaluate the actual economic significance of the reduction in transport costs, although it must be said that it is difficult to provide conclusions for all types of transport due to lack of empirical data.

Dahl's notion that 'A gets B to do something that he or she would not otherwise do' initiated a fiercely contested Anglo-American academic dialogue during the 1960s concerning how power should be conceptualized within the study of politics. Attempts to define political power have been controversial. Before the various approaches towards power can be addressed however, one must first establish and define the theories of pluralism and elitism within which lie the assumptions upon which these approaches are forged. Dahl's pluralist conception depicted political power as an essentially decision making phenomenon.

Some health inequalities are likely never to be resolved because of their essentially genetic nature e.g. higher male mortality in cardiovascular disease.

Introduction</heading>The archaeology of the Bronze Age of the Greek mainland has traditionally entailed attempts to confirm the Homeric texts, stylistic comparisons of architecture, artistic appreciations of finds and detailed examinations of pottery in order to achieve chronological refinements. The notion of the 'state' in archaeology implicates evolutionary thinking and theories influenced by the social and biological sciences (Chapman, 2003). However, the term 'state' has advantages over the traditional approaches. It can prove to be a useful analytical tool for understanding the structure of mainland societies as it encompasses specific organisational attributes. In order to address the first part of the question it is necessary to identify the point in time when states become visible archaeologically. Since complex chiefdoms exemplify social inequality and a hierarchical structure, these can be regarded as precursors to state societies (Flannery, 1999: 4). Therefore, one needs to ascertain when mainland societies had clearly passed the 'threshold' from chiefdom to statehood. Consequently, the early state can be defined as the first state to emerge following the chiefdom mode of organisation. It ought to be emphasised that the definition of 'early state' within archaeology is a contested issue. Smith (2003: 17, 19, 87, 275, 277) rightly stresses...",You are a university student.

The exclusion from the analysis of international society theory amongst other constructivist and reflectivist approaches does not reflect disregard for the considerable achievements this approach has made, merely an acceptance that there is only so much one can cover in two thousand words. Liberalism's central concern is the liberty of the individual. It posits that the main determinants of world peace are: open state governments which are responsive to the needs of its individual citizens; inter-state governments which could help safeguard the rights of these individuals; international cooperation which would foster a sentiment of trust across all national boundaries; and finally free trade which would further entrench the notion of a shared purpose between countries. <fnote>Baylis, J., Smith, S.

BAWE,BAWE_192,"Are There Two Systems of Reasoning? Make Reference to Sloman (1996), and Stanovich and West (2000)","Duality in reasoning is the claim that humans have two distinct separate reasoning styles, a concept proposed by Sloman (1996), and Stanovich and West (2000). Both papers present a different perspective of reasoning which in turn leads to a difference in the interaction between the systems presented, viewing the interaction differently influences the implications this produces for everyday life. Sloman (1996) proposes that humans have two systems of reasoning because ultimately it feels as if humans do; one reasoning system is driven by rules and the other associations. Stanovich and West (2000) claim that human development has evolved a rule based 'evolutionary' reasoning as well as a second rational reasoning style. Stanovich and West's (2000) paper does provide a clearer and more intuitive argument, yet both Sloman (1996) and Stanovich and West's (2000) theories raise problems which mean that a complete acceptance of duality in reasoning cannot be obtained from these theories alone. A study conducted by Osherson and colleagues showed people use different parts of the brain for inductive and deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning is when conclusions are generalised from one premise to another, and deductive reasoning is when certain conclusions are necessarily reached because particular premises have been...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_79,Does Ranke deserve the title 'father of scientific history'?,"Leopold van Ranke has traditionally been seen as the 'father of scientific history' primarily due to the innovative way in which he conducted research and produced historical works - 'Practitioners of quite different fields acknowledged that Ranke's kind of history was something radically new."" He was given the aforementioned title by Herbert Baxter Adams, one of the founders of American graduate training. This anointment was mainly due to his incessant footnoting, his fascination in dealing with archive materials and his use of appendices. However, this attitude has been challenged by a number of historians, who have suggested that Ranke's style of history was not as pioneering as first thought. It is also important to take into account not only whether Ranke's method was scientific but whether this term could also be applied to his historical outlook in general. This essay, therefore, will analyse whether it is possible to classify Ranke as the 'father of scientific history'. It will ultimately come to the conclusion that this title can probably be bestowed upon Ranke in relation to his historical method but that it certainly could not be applied to him in terms of his historical stance.

BAWE,BAWE_570,'Competition law is a pointless tool in the hands of competition authorities if it is not backed by stringent powers of enforcement.',"Promoting competition is ultimately the most important responsibility delegated to competition authorities. But how exactly is this achieved? Competition authorities are equipped with tools to combat anti-competitive practices and behaviour; one of these tools is the powers of enforcement. For the purpose of this essay the powers of enforcement are to encompass many different aspects such as the powers of investigation, powers to impose penalties and powers to order the termination of infringements. However competition authorities cannot apply competition law effectively if the law itself is not bolstered by strict and precise enforcement powers. Therefore this essay will seek to explore how enforcement powers held by the United Kingdom national competition authority, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), have developed since the implementation of the Competition Act 1998, Regulation 1/2003/EC and Enterprise Act 2002. In addition an analysis of the interrelationship between the European Commission's enforcement powers and Regulation 1/2003/EC will be conducted.

BAWE,BAWE_176,In what ways has feminism challenged conventional thinking about politics?,"It is no doubt true that successfully challenging prevailing modes of thinking about the political world can lead to positive changes for people at 'ground-level.' For instance, Marx's analysis of the relationship between capital and labour opened many people's eyes to the injustice inherent within capitalism and provided the working class inspiration to free themselves from the shackles of exploitation, and likewise the myriad feminist interpretations of society have provided people with not only the knowledge that gross inequities between men and women exists, but also the belief that they should be eradicated. Thus assessing the contribution of all the disparate strands of feminism is important as it can allow feminists to see what their predecessors had and had not succeeded in challenging and in turn decide what would be the most efficacious direction for the movement(s) to take in the Twenty-First century. In this essay the analysis will be confined to the effects of the discourses that are part of the feminist 'second-wave.' The analysis will focus on three areas where feminist thinking seems to have contributed to most: the debate on patriarchal order, on the delineations between the public and private, and on the relationship between sex and...",You are a university student.

Analyse and explain the changes referred to here.","<heading>Introduction</heading>The reforms that have brought about the reconstitution of social housing necessitate a re-conceptualisation of the term itself. Up to the mid-1970s it was easy for academics to define the social rented sector. It had four distinguishing factors: its housing was built primarily with the help of state finance its housing was subsidised by the national government its main administrator was either the local council or non-profit organisations operating under the aegis of the government its rents were held below market levels. Since then, there has been a tendency for governments to facilitate the increasing role of private business in social housing and simultaneously increase their own role in expanding other tenures, blurring the once sharp division between the ""private"" and ""public"". In such a way, factor 1) is no longer applicable because spending on social housing is now overwhelmingly financed by borrowing from capital markets. Factor 2) can no longer be considered as a necessary condition because of the increasing complexity and proliferation in subsidies that benefit homeowners and tenants and landlords in the private-rented sector. However, factor 3) can still rightly be maintained as necessary conditions because private landlords rarely put the profits they accrue back into their...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_39,Are there any tetrachromats? Why would we expect them to be women? How would their vision be different to trichromats?,"Human colour vision can most often be described as trichromatic. Having trichromatic colour vision entails having three types of wavelength specific cones in the retina, each of which are maximally responsive to short, medium or long wavelengths of light in the colour spectrum. Short, medium and long wavelength cones maximally respond to blue, green and red light respectively (Goldstein, 2002). Trichromacy is not a uniform feature of human physiology however. Because colour vision is inherited genetically, with medium and long wavelength specific genes being located on the x chromosome, mutations can occur. These mutations can cause a type of colour blindness called anomalous trichromacy, in which the red photopsin becomes slightly shifted (Sanocki, Shevell, Winderickx, 1993). If a woman inherits the three cones for normal trichromacy on one x chromosome, and the three cones for anomalous trichromacy on the other x chromosomes, she will possess two types of red photopsin and therefore have the possibility of four wavelength specific cones. If having four different wavelength specific cones defines tetrachromacy it is highly likely that there are tetrachromats (Jameson, Highnote and Wasserman, 2001). If, however, tetrachromacy is defined by the visual system acting upon this extra cone and creating the neural...",You are a university student.

A study by the World Trade Organisation in 1995 highlighted some one hundred regional trade agreements in 1995 worldwide. The vast institutional development of the European Union has led to an even larger economic market whilst mechanisms of cooperation in economic and security fields have evolved elsewhere. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) (1967) and the subsequent Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) (1989) have flourished, whilst regionalism has also occurred within North and Latin America; the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) respectively. It is important to emphasise the focus within such regional projects, whether it be upon economic, political or security issues. Yet it is first necessary to define regionalism, for it is a term often confused with more vague forms of cooperation, and to establish a definition of sovereignty.

Despite many attempts to attach priority to a certain aspect of imperialism as being the driving force behind the phenomenon, it is perhaps more helpful to understand it as a product of a complex web of motives and concerns. Also, imperialism must be examined in the context of its time (post-enlightenment ideas, rapid industrialisation, the formation of scientific theories which supported the superiority of one race over another, nationalism, and the economic depression of 1873), without which, the phenomenon either would not have occurred, or might have taken on a...",You are a university student.

Moving with caution, Piłsudski, Head of State and Supreme Commander of the Polish troops, in December 1918 even went as far as addressing his archrival Dmowski of the Polish National Committee in Paris as 'My Dear Roman' in an attempt to reconcile the Polish feuding factions. From the outset, it appeared that Poland's independence 'would depend almost exclusively on the endeavours of the Poles themselves', however, soon after the official acknowledgement of Poland's Second Republic, the political struggle grew bitter. It was only the realisation of Soviet hostility toward their new western neighbour that forced the antagonistic political forces to work together in a somewhat efficient war cabinet, though even then with the greatest difficulty and resentment.

A particular form of generalism, Ross' deontology is firstly explained in more detail and some examples are given on how the theory is supposed to work in the process of moral judgement. The particularist position and criticism of generalism is taken from Jonathan Dancy's paper. Once the theories are defined and more fully explained, the essay presents Dancy's objection to Ross' deontology. I take a closer look at three, in my opinion, most influential arguments Dancy makes: the argument from examples, holism of reason and argument from enabling conditions.

Illustrate your answer with a case study.,"Aside from Indiana Jones-esque discoveries of treasure hoards, the aspect of archaeology that most captures public interest is surely contact with physical remains of people from the past. Seeing the bones of a person who lived hundreds, even thousands of years ago, makes us feel a strong a connection with the past, and reminds us of our own mortality. Archaeologists expend much time and effort on studying human remains, due to their significance in interpreting sites and drawing conclusions with far-reaching implications. When remains have been deliberately disposed of by a society, they can perhaps tell us just as much about the living who performed the disposal as the deceased. A body can inform us of society's attitude towards that person, members of their society once dead, and death as a concept.

By keeping the artefact away from the air waterlogging is able to preserve perishable artefacts for longer periods of time than if they were buried with contact to the air. Thus, in a site which has been waterlogged since the archaeological horizon was deposited, extraordinary insight may be obtained by study of artefacts of leather, wood, textile or similar materials. In dendrochronology, the age of wood can be determined through the counting of the number of annual rings in its cross section. Tree ring growth reflects the rainfall conditions that prevailed during the years of the tree's life. Because rainfall patterns vary annually, any given set of tree ring patterns in a region will form a relatively distinct pattern, identifiable with a particular set of years. By comparing the pattern of tree rings in trees whose lifespans partially overlap; these patterns can be extended back in time. By matching the tree rings on an archaeological sample to the master sequence of tree ring patterns, the absolute age of a sample is established.

Novels have been described as 'long narratives in prose dealing chiefly with contemporary life'. These long narratives generally consist of a detailed plot and storyline, this detail creates a fictional world in which the reader can enter and explore into. Novels are designed for private reading, during this time the reader interacts with the characters and internalises the scene and setting. This fictional world becomes more realistic for the reader when a sense of time is added. When the reader is put into a time-specific moment in a novel, the moment reads with a more realistic feeling. The moment becomes more intimate with the reader, and, by sounding more realistic, the time-specific moment draws the reader into the text more than if time had not been added. This enables the reader to internalise the story more. An example of a time-specific moment in a novel is: <fnote>Rob Pope, The...",You are a university student.

Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) was an anatomist in the era before psychology became its own science. Before 'modern psychology' began, psychology was mixture of elements of other disciplines such as philosophy and physiology. Although Gall is most famous for work on 'crainoscopy' (later called phrenology) which has now been discredited, his extensive work on the brain produced some fundamental findings for psychology. A man who pioneered the change to psychology as its own science, and thus began psychology's ""short history"", was William James (1842-1910) of the United States. James is known as one of the very first true psychologists, because he was one of the first people to think that the time had come for psychology itself to become a science (Fancher, 1996).

The objections suggest that ER is mistaken as: it suggests that reality is shaped by our conceptual framework, the thesis of relativism--is true in some non-relativistic sense, the ER collapses into subjectivism and that it cannot evade that there is, after all, an absolute notion of truth.

These ironical aspects are both evident in the plot and in the relationships between characters, whilst simultaneously being imbedded in the structure of the text. Les Liaisons dangereuses is written in the form of a series of letters and this status as an epistolary novel serves to immediately introduce an element of irony into the text; enabling Laclos to highlight the dichotomy between the proximity of the 'dangerous acquaintances' and the distance suggested by the form of the letter. The act of writing a letter implies an intimate and deeply personal relationship, yet this notion is subverted by Laclos, who explores the ways in which this form of expression can be corrupted and used perversely.

Functionalism maintains types of mental states are types of functional/causal states. What tokens of any distinct mental types have in common is the functional/causal role they play.

The two characters, Quoyle and Estha, from 4 a) and 4b) respectively, are presented indirectly through narrative description, instead of direct speech, act, or thought representation. Their joint theme seems to be that the narrator, whoever s/he is, tries to, using varying facts, forms of description and conjecture, account for, or understand the character in question. The main aim of this essay will be to discern and analyse the function of the writers' different techniques that contribute to the narrator-character-reader dynamic. One of the first things to notice is that whilst 4 b) is simply prose, 4 b) is a shorter piece of prose, with a picture, a dictionary-style definition of 'Quoyle' and the title 'Quoyle' in bold. Before discussing the latter generic and graphological deviations, we will discuss something that the length of the pieces drew attention to. Their differences in length lead to doing a word count: 4 b) has 203 words and 4 a) had 165, which in itself is unremarkable.

BAWE,BAWE_283,Escaping from Cynicism in Interstate Relations: A Review of World Views on International Politics,"Of all the areas of social science studied today, world politics may be one of the oldest and most persistently controversial. Over the years, changes in political interactions have sparked the emergence of numerous different approaches to the field. Today, the 'world views' that remain dominant are Realism, Liberalism, and Marxism. Each of these theories rests on distinct assumptions which shape both their interpretations of world events, and, more importantly, how international politicians consider the world when taking decisions. An understanding of these world views is therefore essential to students of world politics, as they not only help us to interpret the past, but to understand the likely future development of international relations. As we enter the 21 st Century, Marxism seems to be regaining the momentum that it lost with the end of the Cold War, while Realism arguably triumphs in the academic domain, and liberalism is most often used to support political moves. To comprehensively study world politics it is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of these approaches in explaining today's world; one may do so by comparing Realism, liberalism and Marxism based on their main assumptions and on their degree of empirical backing throughout history.

BAWE,BAWE_38,Why are some children more popular than others and what consequences does this have for psychological development?,"Popularity is an extremely difficult concept to measure as popularity is variable across cultures and ages. Characteristics defining a child as popular at the age of 8 may not be the same characteristics which define a child as popular at 14. Another problem arises distinguishing friendship from popularity. A child may be perceived as unpopular but still have a few close friends, and it is important to consider this when looking at psychological development because popularity is multi-faceted as opposed to one dimensional. It has been shown that unpopular children are more likely to have psychological difficulties such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, mood disorders and criminal behaviour (Kupersmidt, Coie and Dodge, 1990). Because of this, an important issue when looking at the effect of popularity on psychological development is cause and effect. This issue is covered extensively in the essay as it is valuable, yet difficult, to try and determine whether being unpopular causes problems with psychological development, or whether underlying psychological difficulties cause the child to behave inappropriately and become unpopular. Popularity is an extremely important issue affecting all children. It is more important now than ever as parents tend to return earlier to work so children tend to...",You are a university student.

The appeal of new, 'virgin' lands full of opportunity and the possibility of finding exotic treasures similar to the gold and silver found in South America were all key reasons for European countries to begin colonisation. Add to this the existing social, and often religious, unrest found in many parts of Europe and migration to America seemed like the perfect solution. Initially, many of those who wanted to journey to America were solely interested in making their fortune and wanted to find passages enabling quicker access to the spices of Asia. Despite there often being a lack of interest from the English crown, 'the prospects of finding a passage to Asia or getting around in front of Spanish exploitation of the interior were still powerful lures to imaginative men'. This was true not only just of England but of France, Spain, and possibly to a lesser extent, Holland too. Both John Cabot and Christopher...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_410,"Were Proletarian Factory Workers less likely than Artisans to Participate in Industrial and Political Militancy - and if so, why?","There is a strong argument that it was indeed artisans who were the most likely group to participate in militant action in the nineteenth century as their tradition and culture was one of social and moral solidarity. It seemed to take a longer period of time for proletarian workers to find this solidarity, to organise themselves and to raise a so called 'class consciousness'. There were exceptions, of course, but I will attempt to show why I agree with scholars such as Craig Calhoun that it was primarily artisans that resisted the changes brought by industrialization and who seemed to have more of a sense of unity in comparison to the factory workers. In many of the large-scale disturbances across Europe, for example the Paris Commune in 1871, the Chartist protests and the tailors' strike in England in 1834, it was artisans who made up the majority of those taking part. William Sewell agrees as he says ""down to the commune of 1871, the history of working-class protest in France was essentially the history of artisan protest."" Indeed, the thousands who were killed and arrested during the Paris Commune were predominantly tailors, shoemakers, building craftsmen and furniture makers; skilled workers...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_767,The Dichotomies of Nature-Culture/Nature-Society: A review of the recent critical discussions,"As of recent years anthropology as a subject has developed a healthy reputation for self-criticism and reflection. Stemming largely from the desire to avoid the harsh glare of the ethnocentric critical light, traditional categories including colonialism, politics, society and even styles of ethnographic writing have undergone deconstructions that were much needed if not openly welcomed. The categorical manifestation of the dualist paradigm is represented in the form of the nature-culture and nature-society dichotomies which, as it is now universally agreed, represent little more than stumbling blocks in our attempts to understand the particular intricacies of human societies. Until, recently this dualistic interpretation has proved surprisingly resilient to criticism. The sustained survival of which may owe its existence in part to a paradox within which nature has been much more than the basic term of a series of antithetical notions, an oppositional prop for culture, the supernatural or society. As Philippe Descola states, ""What is distinguished from nature receives its determination from it... Suppress the idea of nature and the whole philosophical edifice of western achievement will crumble"" (Descola/1996/p98).

However despite all the money that has been spent on malaria no drug has been created that is 100% protective against all the strains of malaria and there still remain some resilient strains that present day drugs have no effect on. The amount of money going on research is a significantly large sum, but unfortunately the results coming out are still not significant enough to combat malaria. However in the past more money has been spent in other fields of medical research, such as cancer research (the current amount spent on cancer depends on the type of cancer), than in malaria research.

The exact technique of this varies from society to society but most, employ the same concepts as each other but practice them in different ways depending on the development of the society and on its culture.

The State or the Governement is at the top which within itself also has a head- In Britain for example, the head of state would be the Monarch or the Prime Minister.

As Zeus picks up one of the chessmen and moves it forward, Hera's face gets clouded over with a worry towards one of her favourite immortal men, Jason, and meanwhile in the lower world Jason and his comrades in the ship Argo are attacked by a huge sea-monster. This motif of Olympian gods playing a game in the affairs of men, created by Don Chaffey in his film 'Jason and the Argonauts'(1963), is probably one of the most effective illustrations of a popular view towards the relationship between gods and men in the world of ancient Greek myth and epic. In Homeric epic, we are repeatedly taken up and down between the world of mortals and the Mount Olympus and are shown to how the affairs among gods affect men and how they turn the story.

It will also explain throughout how the proficiency of a health professional to be an effective communicator can either hinder or help their therapy practice, with particular reference to dieticians. Communication can be described and defined in a number of different ways including; as a linear process and as a transactive process. (Berkoal. 1997) The linear process model describes communication simply as; a sender sending a message through a channel to a receiver. This explanation of communication is obviously too simplistic and has been criticised for suggesting it is a one- way process. The transactive process views communication as more involved and has suggested seven characteristics that affect communication. These include; messages are sent and received simultaneously, the meaning of a message depends on the situation and that messages received will have a consequence. (Berkoal. 1997) Although the transactive process is obviously an attempt to demonstrate the complexity of communication, some experts would still criticise it as being too simplistic.

Typical child language acquisition maps stages at which each of these 'levels' develop and become gradually more sophisticated, however, in atypical language development these 'levels' often appear impaired. Kaiser et al (2001:145) state that children with developmental disabilities exhibit cognitive, perceptual and social characteristics that result in modest to severe disruptions of the normal language learning process. These disruptions are mainly manifested through language delays which, although detrimental, offer an insight into language development of atypical individuals in a more detailed way due to each stage developing at a slower rate (Tager-Flusberg, 1999: 311).

Traditionally, dividends were predominant mechanism firms used to deliver their permanent earnings, while share repurchases was relatively unimportant until mid-1980. A study conducted by Fama and French (2001) based on the US companies shows the proportion of firms paying dividends decreased sharply after 1978 (from 66.5% to 20.8% in 1999). Meanwhile, Grullon and Michaely (2002) observed there was an increasing propensity in the recent years of purchasing stocks, and the evidence shows the expenditures on shares repurchase program relative to total earnings increased dramatically from 4.8% in 1980 to 41.8% in 2000( see Figure 1). <figure/>Thus, in order to understand how the firms choose one method over another, the assay will especially focus on the potential motives behind firms to distribute its retained earnings via dividends or stock repurchases. <heading>2 Dividends Policy</heading>A dividend is a cash payment made by the corporation to its common share holders pro rata.

Russia's population in 1905 was very large and very mixed, only about fifty percent of this population was infact Russian.

BAWE,BAWE_259,Critically assess the major conceptual ideas of Liberals about International Relations,"As Michael Doyle points out: ""There is no canonical description of Liberalism"". The lack of a single voice is a trait common to all theories of International Relations. Despite this, there are 'major conceptual ideas' which allow Liberalism to distinguish itself as a separate theory of International Relations. The two major conceptual ideas which form the normative basis and ultimate goal of all strands of Liberalism, (the identification of which can be supported by John Gray, Kant and Keohane - see footnotes), can be summarised as follows: 1. The melioric principle that human beings and the life of humans can be subject to improvability. 2. The emphasis on individual rights and freedoms as a means by which improvability can progress. However, as with all theories of International Relations, normative goals require a method of implementation. For Liberals, this implementation is based on the major conceptual idea of working within the present contextual and structural framework of International Relations in order to promote reform. <fnote>Doyle, M.

BAWE,BAWE_250,"Give a close analysis of Gabriela Mistral's ""La Tierra"".","The early work of the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral was rooted around the central themes of maternal love, nature and childhood. Her third poetic collection, ""Ternura"", published in 1924, made frequent use of this thematic core, exploring the maternal relationship and the inherent connection between nature and femaleness. Critical interpretation of her work, such as the analysis of Manuel Pedro Gonzalez, posits this focus to be a consequence of events within her own life, regarding the mysterious suicide of her lover Romelio Ureta in 1909 as eliciting a perennial yearning for an unrealised maternity. Mistral's rural background and experiences as an unqualified teacher certainly influenced the subject and direction of her work, ingraining a profound appreciation of nature and its forces, and the indigenous cultural traditions constructed around them, as well as the social value of the teaching profession. The poem ""La Tierra"", from ""Cuenta-Mundo"", the fifth section of ""Ternura"", encompasses a conspicuous lauding of the rural, Indian lifestyle of which the poet was so familiar. Constructed as a maternal tutoring of a child, the poem celebrates a mode of living that, though human and entailing the use of artificial instruments, maintains a close harmony with natural forces.

Despite the consolidation of power during the reign of the Emperor Kangsi to Qianlong, there remained however, certain underlying grievances that were never fully eradicated, which led to the persistence of the themes such as 'Over-throw the Qing, Restore the Ming', ethnic and religious tensions. The end of the Qianlong era marked the conclusion of the golden age of Qing rule and saw the gradual decline of central power vis-à-vis the provincial power and the emerging western participation in Chinese politics. Though westerners have had a presence in China dating back to the Yuan dynasty, the Opium Wars and the corresponding treaty system marked a watershed for China-West relations, resulting in the change of status quo, of perceptions; and manifested itself in the increasingly intrusive presence of the West, which exposed the many weaknesses of the Qing state, making it more vulnerable to attacks from within.

These two conflicting ideologies are commonly known as the 'Multiregionalist model' and the 'Out of Africa 2 Model.' Supporters of the former model believe a hominid, namely Homo erectus, left Africa some time in the past one to two million years and colonized Europe and Asia.

Although many Native Americans still live in North America today, proving that as a race they have not been eradicated, their culture and significance have been eroded to such a degree that they can be deemed to have suffered a terrible fate as a people. For several millennia Native Americans prospered on the continent of North America without interference.

BAWE,BAWE_307,The Social Construction Of Black Masculinity Necessarily Manifests Contradictory Experiences. Critically Discuss.,"Society has always had a preconceived notion of black masculinity. Earlier theories of black masculinity pathologised black male sexuality. (Marriot, 1996) This racist attitude inevitably was at its peak during the years of slavery. Nineteenth century plantation societies saw the emasculation of black male slaves as they were stripped of all the symbols of masculinity - as defined by that society. However, with the twentieth century and the Black Power Movements there rose a different image of the black male as being hypermasculine, and this image became another racial stereotype with prominent figures in popular culture endorsing it. Ironically, much of the tension regarding the hypermasculine stereotype of black men is a logical cultural development for a group systematically denied full access to the socially constructed ideals of masculinity. As Bell Hooks or Kobena Mercer argue, historically the black man was denied the attributes of patriarchy. Whereas prevailing notions of masculinity imply power, authority and control, these were historically denied to black men since slavery. The new black masculinity, which Hooks, Hortense Spillers, Michelle Wallace and other feminists state as patriarchal phallocentrism, is however supported by many black male scholars.

Discuss the form and likely impact of new legal rights to information and consultation","The emergence of new regulations on information and consultation rights for employees in the UK, transpositioned from the EU information and consultation Directive (Directive 2002/14/EC OJ L80/29-34) has provoked keen interest and reactions from industrial relations scholars, employers' and employees' bodies, official authorities and trade union organisations. The importance of these new rules is defined, on the one hand, by the legal implications arising from that for the first time the UK has, as Hall (2005:103) puts it 'a general statutory framework giving employees the right to insist on being informed and consulted by their employers on a range of key business, employment and restructuring issues'. On the other hand, the new regulations are perceived by many as key, as they objectify a possible answer to a major problem in UK industrial relations - the 'representation gap'. The evidence that such a 'representation gap' exists is quite strong - in their analysis of the first findings of the Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) 2004, Kersley et al summarise that only 36% of workplaces (both private and public sector) with 10 and more employees in the UK have trade union members.

Both men were elected democratically, both were ousted by illegitimate army coups, both died in office (although in radically different circumstances) and both were carried into rule and supported during government by the workers, as the power of the people asserted itself in Latin America against the oligarchs, the capitalists, the 'imperialist' foreign companies and the conservative forces of politics and the military. It was the overwhelming support of the working class that defined the two governments; Perón and Allende, beloved by their descamisados and compañeros respectively, were two different animals completely, one a Marxist Socialist, the other an authoritarian army Corporatist, and the explanation for how that happened has to be something more satisfactory than the assumption that all working class naturally support socialism and therefore Perón, who has been simplistically categorised as a Fascist, must have fooled the immature Argentine working...",You are a university student.

In this essay, I will attempt to analyse the merits of these theories when used in understanding the international political system. As well as this, I will advocate my own judgment on the effectiveness of the theories and come to a conclusion as to which is most successful in justifying the contemporary world order. As mentioned previously, the dominant theory of International Relations is Realism. Perhaps this is due to its ability to justify the constant state of war that the world seems to be in. For realists, the sovereign state is the dominant actor in the anarchical world system. The theory suggests that individual states organise their actions, face the world as a unitary actor and proceed rationally to pursue state interests of power and security. Realists imply that the absence of a sovereign body from the international realm is cause for bargaining, alliances and the inevitable use of military force between states that seek to maintain security and to accumulate power.

How fully did it met the demands of the script, and did it constitute an interpretation of it?","Following the premiere of his controverisal black-comedy The Lieutenant of Inishmore (2001), Martin McDonagh declared that he would write no new material until the staging of his back-catalogue. McDonagh's newest play The Pillowman is therefore one of his earlier works, and on comparison is notably dissimilar from the author's other offerings. Replacing the rural Irish setting of plays such as The Beauty Queen of Leenane and The Cripple of Inishmaan with a stark portrayal of a vaguely Eastern European totalitarian state, The Pillowman also ventures from McDonagh's traditional naturalistic format. Substantiating the tension of a grimy police cell, in which the writer Katurian Katurian is interrogated on the corrolation between the content of his stories and a series of grisly child-murders, are abstract explorations of artistic responsibility and child abuse through the medium of fairy tales. What punctuates the play, however, is the 'absolutely McDonaghesque' (Independent Sunday, David Benedict, 23.11.03) humour, and like his previous offerings, The Pillowman reverbs with the wildly disturbing and the blackly comic.

BAWE,BAWE_180,Coordination of Wage Bargaining - Does it increase mark-up and generate higher prices?,"Price determination has received an increasingly important position in contemporary literature, as it is essential to our understanding of the complex issues of unemployment and inflation. The increasing attention of policymakers regarding inflation targets has necessitated further research in this field. Nevertheless, there is surprisingly little literature on both single country and cross-country price determination analysis. Still, some interest has been put in different theories of price determination, and the two most central theories are the purchasing power theory (the law of one price) and the mark-up theory. The purchasing power theory asserts that prices are determined in the long run by world competition, thus the theory emphasises the importance of import prices. The mark-up theory developed by Kalecki states that producers set prices as a mark-up over average variable costs, partly as an insurance against variability in input prices and partly to earn profits. Martin advocate, through his theoretical and empirical assessment of the UK economy, that reality is somewhat in the middle of these two main theories. He shows that interactions between domestic and foreign actors cannot be neglected when it comes to theories of price formation, thus both domestic costs and import prices are important in determining...",You are a university student.

What are the strengths and weaknesses you see in the case you have constructed?,"The question of whether or not there is a general factor in intelligence, or g, has been a massive debate in psychology and the answer has important implications for society and psychology. Spearman (1904, cited in Deary 2001) first described g after finding several different mental abilities were positively correlated, and inferred from this that there was some underlying general factor that was influencing different abilities. This theory has been taken and developed in various ways by different psychologists over the past 100 years, but this approach has not been without it's dissenters, and there has been significant opposition, for example by Gardner's (1993) claim of multiple intelligences. Rather than being dismissed, these detractors should be answered, and unfortunately this has not always happened in this debate. The case for a theory of general intelligence can be supported by research and theories from many areas of psychology. Firstly, there is the evidence from psychometric testing, and basic level cognitive task studies such as reaction time. Then there is mounting evidence from biological psychology, with suggestions of brain structures that might be the biological basis of g.

It originates from the existing Summit Conferences of the Heads of States which have been held since 1969. It was created in 1974 as a response to a growing feeling by European leaders that the European Economic Community needed stronger leadership to overcome the stagnation in Community legislation and, the financial crises of the early seventies, which showed that ""the Western currencies were so closely intertwined such that national governments could no longer preserve their national economic autonomy"". The urgency to reaffirm the position of Western Europe in an increasingly economically interdependent world confirmed the critical importance of the European Council in shaping Community legislation in a clearer direction.

These bizarre incidents resulted in mass witchcraft hysteria and paranoia as the adolescents accused numerous residents of the Salem of witchcraft and dealings with Satan.

In the following interpretation of Heraclitus, the idea of Logos shall be taken to mean the unified being that is the true nature of the world. It is this definition which is vital to Heraclitus' ideas, and has a bearing on his notion of the nature of reality; the effect of language on our conception of that reality and his ideas about the path to true knowledge.

Explain why critics believe the ratio no longer holds.,"In 1958, a study published by Alan W Phillips aimed to establish a negative relation between inflation and unemployment. His examination of the major economies of the world revealed a clear 'trade-off' between inflation and unemployment, his findings coming to be known as the 'Phillips Curve'. The establishment of such a relationship became a topic of significant interest to scholars and politicians alike; if such a relationship did exist, it carried with it a number of significant policy implications; the idea that Governments could maintain low levels of unemployment, by tolerating higher inflation rates. However, during the 1970's, the relationship appeared to break down, thus inciting scholars from all economic schools of thought, to attach their own theoretical explanations as to why the relationship no longer appeared to hold. Firstly this essay will investigate the derivation of Phillips curve in its original context, before exploring the developments provided by main scholars from the Keynesian, Monetarist and Neo-Classical schools of thought following the breakdown of the relationship.

The Egyptians and all Eastern civilisations would have also been called barbarians as their beliefs and customs were different to that of the Greeks.

Furthermore, when faced with an opportunity, an entrepreneur must be able to access and gain relevant resources and then co-ordinate and configure them in a particularly appropriate way so that collectively they deliver value in a unique and inimitable manner. Another important aspect is that entrepreneurs must discover and exploit the opportunities that are not being used and it is through competitive advantage that the firm attempts to exploit these opportunities. Thus, even though, the entrepreneurial venture is built from innovative combinations of financial, operating and human resources, the network is more crucial key to the success as it provides resources critical to the firm's competitive strategy, where it will allow the firm to break into new markets during the crucial early stage development of the new business and provide a competitive advantage.

Foucault claimed that the traditional view of the author was simply a modern construction seeking to exalt the author to an omniscient position. However, he felt that in reality the author has no authority over their text, as the reader cannot know the author and therefore cannot interpret the author's intentions. Moreover, he felt it was unnecessary to know the author's intention; what was more important was for the reader to be able to bring their own meaning and interpretation from the text for their own use. Other Postmodern thinkers have taken this idea further, treating the world as a text and the individuals habiting the world as the readers. The individual has no clear authority or standards by which to interpret the world and is consequently left to discover 'truth' for themselves, and to live in a way which best serves themselves and their needs.

Their violent and exaggerated behaviours are perhaps a representation of uncontrollability, allegories of chaos which must be overcome under the watchful eyes of the gods, in order to free society from their evils. Both the hybrid and monstrous creatures appear to symbolise the forces that threaten civilisation, presented by the gods and conquerable only by heroes. Hybrids can range from savage centaurs to beautiful mermaids, and in a reflection of the changing temperament of nature, those which might at first seem beautiful and enticing like the sirens and mermaids, can prove treacherous and fatal upon closer inspection. In an exploration of roles played by monstrous and hybrid creatures we expose society's need for a manifestation of evil that can be defeated, a basis of control where in a Greek society the gods can bring order to chaos and make sense of the evils in the world, be in morality or in the violence of nature.

In particular, it looks for a defensible interpretation of the central claim that meaning of an expression is an idea in the mind. The paper proceeds in two parts where the first part gives a brief description of the basic interpretation in the form of Locke's theory of meaning, then discusses central objections to it and looks for solutions which would refine the interpretation and make it more defensible. The central thesis is that Locke's claim is essentially faulty as it fails describe the concept of meaning in its complexity. Any interpretation of the claim will fail as ideas are not sufficient to provide meaning for expressions. Central objections to the claim address the referential problem of the theory for both words as well as sentences.

Schofield, The Population History of England, 1541 - 1871: A Reconstruction, which set out calculated estimates of population trends for this period. They used the method of back-projection to estimate the population levels of the country between 1541 (the beginning of the first decade after the introduction of parish registers) and 1871 (the date of the second reliable census). This project was an immense undertaking which used four hundred and four surviving parish registers which recorded baptism, marriage and burial, to estimate demographic trends at five year intervals between these two dates. Many criticisms of both the methodology used and the results achieved have been made of this study. In very general terms these criticisms focus upon the following main areas. The sample of four hundred and four parish registers used to estimate national population figures makes up only four percent of the total number of parishes in early modern England. In addition, the sample includes too many large parishes (usually Northern areas) and too few smaller parishes (usually Eastern areas).

Carrera was the most powerful of the Central American leaders and Dr Francia may be said to be the one who controlled his country with the most rigor. After the demise of Spanish authority in South America, several problems arose for the Countries that were left in the aftermath of independence. One problem for these countries was the discontented lower classes and indigenous populations, who were becoming annoyed at their way of living in Guatemala, and who were fighting amongst themselves in Paraguay. Another was the rise of Creole elites, who challenged the continuing presence of conservative. Independence meant that these land owning elites were now legitimized in ruling without the interference of the Spanish. One may question the problems that a government would face by having to rule with the liberalistic policies of the revolution, with the conservative institutions left by the Spanish, yet a dictator such as Carrera or Francia could rule how they wanted to.

Since it is established that performance in the workplace depends on how much and on the reason why an individual is willing to act (Gellerman 1965: 7), the question remains on what best explains human incentive. The purpose of this paper is to assess which motivation theory best explains people's willingness to work hard. The paper reflects on human motivation with relevance to different views on human nature, and examines a selection of individual needs and motivation theories. There are two main types of motivational theories, namely content and process theories. The main difference is the assumption on individual needs at work. Content theories assume that all people have the same set of needs, and that these needs motivate behavior (Fincham & Rhodes 2005: 193). In contrast, process theories assume that all humans have different needs, and focus on how cognitive processes, or ""the way we take in and process information about ourselves and the world,"" (Fincham & Rhodes 2005: 193) influences these needs. Process theories are more concerned with explaining the effect of individual differences on the level of motivation, so that motivation is a result of...",You are a university student.

(Genet) Analyse the construction of male, female or androgynous roles in two or more plays written since 1880.","Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Lorca's Yerma display two female protagonists who are seen to exercise masculine behaviour throughout their tragedies. Hedda's inactivity and dependence on marriage for financial support is typical of a woman in late 19 th century, Norwegian society. However, as a woman, Hedda is expected to find her raison d'être in being a wife and a mother, but these designs do not at all content her. By rejecting the traditional practices of her gender, she becomes more masculine, which is displayed in her treatment of George Tesman and the power she attains over Eilert Løvborg. Unlike Hedda, Yerma desperately longs to use her ability to reproduce and, in conjunction with society, thinks it's degrading and wasteful to remain barren. As much as she yearns for motherhood, her husband is not at all compelled to have children, discarding Yerma's basic freedoms as a woman. In some ways, Yerma will never have the responsibilities of a man, the strength, or dominance in Spanish society. However, by neglecting the unique, reproductive capabilities of her womanhood, she is no longer defined by her gender and her lifestyle becomes closer to that of a man.

However, Weber would decline any attempt to categorize him as a philosopher. He labeled his works humbly and self-consciously under the name of sociology and national economy and advocated specialization in one's own vocation. Weber has left us with voluminous works covering various spheres of human life, but most of them remained fragmented and seemed to be lack of clear consistency with each other. In his essays of methodology, Weber emphasizes the distinction between empirical knowledge observation and value judgment, and adheres to the principle of ""value neutrality"" in social science, which invites many critiques. Weber is thus often called as ""a nihilist, a relativist, and a decisionist"". (Schluchter, 1979: 59) These critiques are reasonable to some extent, but they have all ignored the background in which modern science is located: the disenchantment and rationalization of the world, which serve to be the central theme of Weber's whole works.

BAWE,BAWE_38,Why are some children more popular than others and what consequences does this have for psychological development?,"In every peer group, there are individuals who stand out as more popular than the rest. Children are no exception, and different children experience varying degrees of social acceptance from their peers. While some are liked and constantly surrounded by friends, others are ignored or even actively disliked. Popular children are those who are sociable and outgoing. They are included in many group activities, receive many positive peer nominations and are rated favourably. Conversely, unpopular children are widely disliked, receive many negative peer nominations or none at all, and are excluded from group activities (Roff, Sells and Golden, 1972; cited by Elkind & Weiner, 1978). It is apparent that some children are more popular than others; but what exactly causes this? Researchers have identified a number of factors which may affect the popularity of a child. These include physical attractiveness, personal name, dexterity and social skills (Bukatko & Daehler, 1992). Generally, physically attractive children are more likely to be popular (Kleck, Richardson, & Ronald, 1974). Lerner & Lerner (1977; cited by Bukatko & Daehler, 1992) found a relationship between children's ratings of peers' attractiveness and sociometric measures of peer acceptance.

BAWE,BAWE_1044,Why was virginity such an important theme in Ancient Myth?,"Myths come from the Greek word mythos, which means ""word"", ""speech"", ""tale"", or ""story"". A myth is a story that would have usually been told orally and then written down in the later years. Myths can also be seen on pottery, paintings, in plays and in music. However, there are some scholars who are not content with this definition of a myth, and want to recognize myths that are 'true' and those that could be confused with a 'folktale' or a 'legend'. Myths were used in ancient society as stories, but also as moral situations and lessons as example for society to follow. They were well known to the public and would have been recognised if for example they were acted out in a play. There were many 'lessons' and themes that occurred in myths such as, glorification, rape, male and female relationships, marriage and also virginity. To understand the reason why virginity was such an important them in myths, different areas of mythology will have to be considered.

A conclusion will then be drawn that Malthus's fears do not necessarily turn true in the modern world. <heading>Analysis</heading>Malthus's model investigated the relationship between population growth and economic growth. According to Malthus, population grow in geometric progression, for example, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64......because of ""unchanging attraction between sexes"". So population doubles each generation. On the other hand, output grows in arithmetic progression, for example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6..... , largely due to diminishing returns to input factors. In other words, the more labour employed holding other input factors constant, output will increase but at a diminishing rate. An example can be used to clarify the theory. Assume that in a country, there are 5 million populations with a level of output satisfying the population. According to Malthus's model, when population grows to 10 million in 100 years, total output will increase twice. In two centuries, population will be 20 million, whereas output level will be only available to 15 million people. It means...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_17,How is the Construction of Gender Identities Related to Imperialism and Racism? Discuss With Particular Reference to Ideas About 'White Manhood' in the Adventure Story of Late Nineteenth Century Britain,"The British project of Imperialism was driven by the 'scientifically' proven belief that white males were the natural, biological, superiors to ethnic minorities and women. Consequently, Englishmen considered it to be their right and duty to subjugate the populations of non-Western countries, disseminating their norms of propriety and their notions of what it meant to be 'civilised'. This essay is concerned with showing that this quest was glorified in the popular fiction of late nineteenth century England, and that the gender identities of English men and women were shaped and reinforced by the portrayal of 'uncivilised' people and uncharted, fantastical, territories. This essay will argue that the construction of gender identity is related to Imperialism and racism as the indigenous people of conquered nations provided white Englishmen with an image of 'uncivilised' people with which they could compare themselves to. Initially, it will be shown that the adventure story of late nineteenth century England provided young Englishmen with the belief that it was their right to propagate Imperialism because of their natural superiority to other ethnicities. It will then be shown that the subconscious dissatisfaction many Englishmen had with the restrictive nature of Victorian society was expressed in their enthusiasm...",You are a university student.

However this has proven to be a difficult task and to require a thorough understanding of the complex and variable health needs of different population groups. Health is defined as ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"". (1) Therefore, in order to account for the health of the nation, not only the physical maladies have to be prevented and treated, the social determinants of health must also be accounted for. This dimension poses the greatest challenge as it involves long-term approaches using profound measures designed to impact not only in lifestyles, but also in social and community networks and general socioeconomic and environmental factors such as income, housing, education, safety, access to fresh food, transport, access to health services.

INTRODUCTION</heading>In this essay I examine Popper's criterion of falsification contrasted against Kuhn's puzzle-solving criterion. Kuhn's normal/revolutionary science and Lakatos's hard core/protective belt ideas are discussed. Thargard's views on astrology are generalised to try and see if they apply to all non-science and thus create demarcation criteria. Whether such criteria exist at all is examined with regard to underdeterminism. If they are to exist what conditions would count as satisfactory is also examined. As the definition of science is discussed below it is not possible to provide a clear definition of it now, but merely state that everything not covered by the term science is deemed non-science. Non-science includes pseudoscience and it is significant to note that any accurate definition of science must also exclude this pseudoscience. Thus I do not attempt to define pseudoscience. It is also beyond my aim to separate science from good science. In this essay I aim to critically examine criteria that claim to define science and discuss what conditions such criteria must have in order to be a satisfactory definition.

Of course it has not been the sole contributing factor and neither should it be. There have been other influences such as classical teachings that helped to mould the common law in a unique way. But to what extent did Judaeo-Christian theology inspire the development of our English common law and the secular legal profession? How important was such a theology to the evolution of common law and the persons involved? These questions are pertinent. This is especially so because the analysis is located within the context of an encroaching Roman civil law system; inclusive of the strict Canon rules of the church. Therefore the essay will begin with an initiative to define the term 'Judaeo-Christian' in order to frame the essay within a suitable background. Subsequently the influences of Judaeo-Christian theology will be analysed in relation to the ideas and writings of mediaeval and early modern commentators such as Sir John Fortescue, William Dugdale and Sir Edward Coke.

BAWE,BAWE_549,What is the Private Language Argument?

The Private Language Argument poses some difficult questions for the Cartesian Subject and they are hard pushed to answer convincingly. If a private language is not possible then it destroys the concept of the soul in the Cartesian sense and as a result it undermines the whole of Cartesian philosophy; if there can be no private language there can be no Cartesian Subject.

Are the two positions reconcilable in the cultural context of the 21st century?,"When Derrida famously declared that 'There is nothing outside the text', his words would have implications not only for literary theorists but for those 'guardians' of literature itself: publishers. Post-Structuralist theory states that a written text is unstable, in an entirely textual world: we cannot talk of a 'real' world outside of language, a cultural reality represented by a work of literature. This, along with the Post-Structuralist theory of the 'Death of the Author' challenges the publisher's traditional role as conservationist of culture, a role that relies on both the intrinsic value of the text and its ability to represent a specific cultural period. Derrida's denial that a written text has any intrinsic worth renders the publisher's role as gatekeeper obsolete. As what Richard Abel describes as a 'cultural gatekeeper', the publisher preserves the text as a valuable cultural commodity, insisting upon the posthumous life of the Author. Furthermore, the modernist desire to preserve the intrinsic worth of books by fighting against the commercialisation of the publishing industry has no place in Post-Structuralist theory, where the decentred commercial universe of the 21 st century offers a textual liberation and plurality that can only be celebrated.

As Ian Kershaw suggested 'The adulation of Hitler by millions of Germans who might otherwise have been only marginally committed to Nazism meant that the person of the Führer, as the focal point of basic consensus, formed a crucial integratory force in the Nazi system of rule."" Despite the concession that Hitler, or rather the 'Hitler myth' played an important role in the third Reich, it does not follow that the influence was necessarily advantageous for Nazi Germany as a dictatorship. The nature of this question is quite deceptive, and the search for a direct answer can be elusive, due to the fact that the line between strength and weakness may be obscured. Hence, what may initially appear to have strengthened the Third Reich may in the long term prove to be the ultimate de-stabilising factor, threatening the very foundations that the Reich was built upon.

BAWE,BAWE_360,Buying vs Renting a Home,"There are several pieces of literature that discuss tenure choice and the costs involved. Megbolugbe and Linneman (1993 p.659) suggest that home ownership should be influenced only by household preferences, income, wealth and the relative costs of owning and renting. They also point out that home ownership is frequently assumed to have no intrinsic value (Linneman and Wachter, 1989). From these premises, I can crudely extrapolate that when individual choices of housing tenures are not distorted the costs of owning and renting would have to equalize at equilibrium. If they didn't, there would be unexhausted gains from trade. The cost of owning would refer to the annual pro-rated cost of the unit, net of all finance payments, taxes, purchase costs, anticipated appreciation (p.667). This is a very questionable extrapolation, and there are other considerations discussed later that would suggest systematic biases in favour of one type of tenure choice. Ex ante, at equilibrium in the real world, relative costs are expected differ. Therefore the one of the empirical focuses of my analysis could be on testing for differences in housing costs.

This is of particular relevance to non-human primates, as approximately 90% of all primate species are restricted to tropical forest habitats. It has been demonstrated that human population growth is linked to global deforestation and that 'human population pressure is the best predictor of tropical deforestation rates'. However, there are non-anthropogenic factors that influence non-human primate distribution and abundance, and these natural species characteristics are important too.

Exchange and specialised production, or craft specialisation as commonly known, have to some extent been emphasised as significant attributes thus projecting the Neolithic into its rightful importance. This has been particularly so since exchange and craft specialisation have implications for the organisation of time and labour and consequently these have been associated with the beginnings of social differentiation. As Renfrew has pointed out (1973: 179, 187), the Neolithic should not be equated only with simple farming communities since there was long-distance trade and craft specialisation in obsidian, Spondylus and textiles. Furthermore, Theocharis (1973: 60), in a social evolutionary mindset, has interpreted the increased standardisation of tools and the large amounts of Melian obsidian in Middle Neolithic Thessaly as indicators of ""stabilisation and improvement"". When using primary material regarding the Aegean Neolithic, a number of limitations emerge in the definition of evidence per se. A certain amount of information from early excavations has been lost.

One of the more favourable solutions they have chosen is nuclear power. The main disadvantage is that the unwanted by-product of nuclear fission process is a large amount of hazardous radioactive waste. For each year that a reactor is in operation a third of its core material - around 30 tons - has to be removed and replaced. During their time within the reactor these uranium fuel rods increase in radioactivity to the extent that when they are removed they contain hundreds of radioactive chemicals that generate large amounts of heat and radiation. This is regarded as high-level waste. The equipment and tools involved in manipulating the materials is categorised as low-level waste, given its relatively short contact time with the reactor.

The poem is written mainly in iambic tetrameter, though there are some inverted feet which stop the poem falling into monotony. An example is the spondee in 'How strongly...', which starts the poem. The stress on the questioning word emphasises the fact that it is a dilemma; the writer is asking us a question. Later in the poem, 'Cure then...' also has two stresses, this makes it sound more like a command than a request and the reader is encouraged by the punctuation to pause after this, which makes it more prominent. The obvious advantage of the metre is that English speech is usually in iambs, so the metre does lend itself to be sung, although the use of masculine rhymes stops the tone becoming too whimsical and draws our attention to the dilemma at hand.

It's author Filippo Tommaso Marinetti had written it from a luxurious 'Villa Rossa' in Milan and pointed to the Parisian public as the target of 'incendiary violence.' Although Paris, enjoying its title as 'cultural capital of the world' was regularly a victim of attacks on the establishment the manifesto showed radical ideas of performance the world had never seen before. Marinetti had lived in Paris from 1893-1896 and had enjoyed living in a circle of friends involved in the arts. Amongst these friends was Alfred Jarry. Marinetti was heavily influenced by Jarry's controversial attitudes to the theatre and many of his ideas for futurist performance can be seen in Jarry's play 'Ubo Roi.' 'Ubo Roi' debuted at Lugne-Poe's Theatre de l'Oeuvre on the 11 th of December 1896 and was modelled on schoolboy farces and puppet shows. The play was a curious ensemble of ideas, which Jarry set up in the preface. These ideas were often contradictory to stimulate the audience.

Even on a day-to-day scale exchanges are taking place all the time in the form of telephone calls, letters, dances, dinner parties and just conversations in general. Gifts can express relationships, mark changes of status (motherhood) and other important events. Exchange can also make important changes in lifestyle for example in marriage.

How did foreign wars alter their pact with the nation state?","Nineteenth century Peru witnessed great changes in the state's approach to the indigenous majority, with the issue of the ""Indian Problem"" proving central to debate about the country's postcolonial direction. Peru emerged after independence as a thoroughly divided nation, comprising a small pool of largely city-residing elites and a peasant mass scattered throughout its diverse landscape. With the development of a significant mestizo class, in addition to the existence of black slaves and imported indentured Chinese labourers, Peru was characterised by ethnic heterogeneity. The peasantry remained overwhelmingly Indian in composition however, inhabiting the composite network of community ayllus littered across the Andean highlands. Though incorporated within the state apparatus - just as they had been under the colonial tribute system - the maintenance of traditional towns and villages would be deemed in opposition to the modernising and republican values of an emergent Creole elite. By the century's end, Peru's Indian mass would see repeated efforts to catalyse its integration within the enterprising trajectory of Lima's intellectuals.

There was an era when Newton's theory of Physics seemed reasonably watertight in explaining the underlying questions of the natural world, but these ideas have since been superseded. We now have Einstein's theory of General Relativity to describe gravitational behaviour on the macro scale, and various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics to illustrate interactive phenomena on the micro scale, however the advance of Physics at this fundamental level is yet still hindered by one major undertaking: the unification of the very big with the very small into one theory - a 'theory of everything.'

The term Human-wildlife conflict refers to the situation where human and animal needs and actions are in conflict with one another. It results in disadvantages for local animal populations or a specific group of people activities; it may also have an impact on the local or national economy. Conflicts between the two are on the increase due to the growing population in present day society.

Considering that Winstanley was only prominent as a writer between 1648-1652, and thereafter faded into oblivion, there seems to be a disproportionate amount of literature written about him, with little consensus over how we should understand such a complex figure. The most prominent debate revolves around Winstanley's evolution as a thinker- while most agree that he started off as a religious thinker, few concur on his predilections (secular or religious or both) in the Law of Freedom in a Platform (1652). While the question above seems to be fairly straightforward, it is in this writer's opinion that the position one takes in the fore-mentioned debate has bearings on how one would view the nature of Winstanley's religious outlook in The New Law of Righteousness (1649).

The working definition of liberal internationalism used here is more inclusive, referring to the so-called ""utopians"" virulently criticized by E.H. Carr. The paper attempts to reveal that the core liberal assumption according to which ideas and morality matter in building an international society, has not been 'demolished' but rather capriciously 'borrowed' by realist thinkers like Carr. The arguments of this paper follow the core liberal creed that ideas and moral visions can influence politics. Moreover, the idea of harmony of interests has not been assumed by all idealists and deserves a more careful examination since it may not necessarily conceal vested interests. The paper concludes that the subtle fact of realists 'borrowing' core liberal assumptions renders their critique a rather ambiguous than a sound one. Carr mentioning of the need for utopia makes us think about the inevitability of consensus. Realism offers a simplistic account of how international relations should be shaped, which in the end is faced with the need of leaving room for normative thinking.

However, since the early writings of Plato philosophers have questioned what it is to know something. Distinctions have been made between capacity knowledge, knowledge by acquaintance and propositional knowledge, each with various difficulties associated with them. The most fundamental debate surrounds the concept of propositional knowledge; what it means to say we know a particular proposition. One such response has been to claim that knowledge is justified true belief. This is known either as the tripartite definition or more generally, the standard analysis. In attempting to define a concept like knowledge, theorists are looking for a set of conditions which cover all aspects of how we use that concept. These conditions must be necessary and sufficient; each condition is essential to the concept and the combination of these conditions is enough to satisfy the demands of the concept. In the case of knowledge as justified true belief, theorists have identified 3 conditions that are said to successfully fill the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge.

It can be argued that this research assumed that female offending was insignificant and therefore did not warrant separate investigation (Hudson 1990:116, Chesney-Lind and Pasko 2004, 15/16, Kersten 1989:129, Cox 2003:9, Summer 1990:47, Oakley in Heidensohn 1989:85, Richie 2004:231).

BAWE,BAWE_19,Critically Evaluate the Assertion that Sporting Practices and their Associated Subcultures Bear no Relation Whatsoever to the Social Construction of Masculine Ideals,"Sporting practices and their associated subcultures have to be conceptualised as possessing a unique nature that allows them to function independently of the societal context within which they exist, if it is to be argued that they bear no relation whatsoever to the social construction of masculine ideals. This is because masculine ideals are created and shaped by the society in which they are located, yet they also affect the natures of the institutions and cultural forces that influence them. This essay is concerned with tracing the historical construction of sport, and with assessing the relationship (if any) in contemporary society between sporting practices, masculine ideals, and the dominant cultural and institutional forces of modern society in order to evaluate whether or not sporting practices are related to the social construction of masculine ideals. This essay will argue that sporting practices are intimately bound up with the social construction of masculine ideals, and that the relationship between sport and society provides crucial insights into the other societal forces that contribute to the forms these ideals take. A central concept that will be employed throughout will be the concept of hegemonic masculinity. Masculine ideals as they exist in contemporary society will...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_835,What were the ecological pressures which caused primate traits to evolve?,"All primates, no matter which family they belong to, share certain traits and anatomical features that set them apart from other mammals. Anthropologist Robert Martin has defined primates according to nine traits by which they can be identified, including features of dentition, gestation and olfaction. Three important traits he identifies are the presence of an opposable pollex and hallux (with the exception of humans who only have an opposable pollex), the dominance of the hindlimb during locomotion and the location of the eyes in the head. It is these three features which have provided anthropologists with much material in the study of primate origins. It is widely agreed that primate traits arose in response to the domination of an arboreal niche, but more specific information is needed about exactly what features of an arboreal habitat led to the last common ancestor of all primates to develop these features. Anthropologists have focussed on different primate features in the search for answers and here I will try to draw the research together and assess which theory provides the fullest explanation.

These physical characteristics made them identifiable as prone to criminality and, on a more general level, subordinate to the aesthetically 'normal' members of society.

In 1911 Frederick Taylor published ""The Principles of Scientific Management"" It was an attempt to document some of these changes, as well as spread these ideas more widely. It is from this book that the concept of Taylorism evolved. Key to the question is that Taylorism was different to what had come before, and that it came about for specific economic reasons. This essay will try to explain what Taylorism is, where it came from, and why it came into any kind of existence at all. When Taylor published his book he believed that the working man had a natural tendency to 'soldiering' This meant that workers did less work than they were physically able to do (Taylor:1911:Chapter 1). Taylor noted two main reasons for this quasi industrial sabotage. Firstly it is that workers do not want to produce too much; as they risked of lowering the value of their, and their fellow worker's labour, in addition to decreasing the amount of labour needed for work.

This article explores this debate focusing on the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM). The extensive literature that has been devoted to this practice and grown throughout the 1990s and the wide-ranging impact that this practice has on wide range of planes from the legal, to the political and the cultural, makes it an ideal case study for an examination of both the advantages and drawbacks of using international human rights law in the struggle for women's human rights. The cultural and religious significance of FGM, its strong links to sexual and reproductive health and rights, and the critiques raised by postcolonial feminists in particular on the dangers of gender essentialism and exclusive focus on violence against women has made FGM a contentious and vigorously debated topic. In the first part of this article, I briefly examine how the practice of FGM gained prominence in the international women's human rights movement. I summarize some of the contentious issues that FGM has raised, particularly the criticism that the FGM campaign essentializes both gender and culture.

BAWE,BAWE_952,In need for stabilisation: the case of the soft fruit market in Poland,"<heading>1. Introduction</heading>With the day of accession to the European Union Poland accepted the Acquis Communautaire as a whole and for thick and thin. As a result it said 'yes' also to five cardinal market-related Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) objectives, outlined in the Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome. As they date back to 1957 these objectives may be viewed as a relic of the past. Europe has moved forward since then, drifting away from the strictly market-related ideas of stabilisation, availability of supplies or increased productivity, towards the more sophisticated approach reflected in the concept of multifunctionality. Nevertheless, in Polish agriculture there are still areas where some of the initial CAP aims remain applicable. The soft fruit market, that experiences repeating crisis situations, can serve as the most glaring example of market instability, that directly hinders its performance. The aim of this essay is to show, that the third CAP objective of market stabilisation, only partially reflected in the Polish strategic document for agriculture, is still relevant to the situation on the soft fruit market in this country, but cannot be met due to the inadequate policy instruments.

An outlook on the Argentine Situation, Prospects and Policy Recommendations","<abstract></abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>The analysis of recent banking crises is one of the most interesting fields in international financial macroeconomics due to their negative effects and recurrence, and the difficulties involved in their resolution. Diaz Alejandro (1985), when referring to the financial liberalisation processes started in the 1970s, anticipated many of these events with the catchy title ""Good-bye financial repression, hello financial crash."" Furthermore, during a new wave of financial liberalisation initiated in the 1990s, banking crises have shown more adverse effects when compared with the 1980s 1. In this context of endemic banking crises a number of interesting questions have been raised among policymakers and academics: What are the causes of such crises? Which policies should be pursued when a crisis arises? How can another collapse be prevented once the crisis vanishes? The Argentine 2001-2 financial turmoil revitalised these questions, exposing new issues due to the severity and extension of the distress, as the Argentine real GDP plummeted around 11% in 2002 while credit to the private sector suffered a 39.2% reduction in real terms (Dec-2002/Dec-2001). Now the GDP has recovered at an unexpectedly high rate of 8% in 2003 while the stock of credit to the private sector fell 18.3% (Dec-2003/Dec-2002)...","You are a university student.

Accountable to very few Stalin was free to pursue any policy largely unchecked. He had support from the party rank and file as well as from the central committee and the Politburo. How Stalin, the least obvious of Lenin's potential successors, came to be in this position is a much contested issue. With his death Lenin left a vacuum within the party leadership creating economic, social and political uncertainty. This in turn led to a left / right divide within the Politburo over the next steps the Bolsheviks should take, with Trotsky on the left arguing for rapid industrialisation. Stalin maintained a generally moderate position before siding with Kamenev and Zinoviev forming a powerful triumvate against the man they saw as their biggest rival. After Trotsky's eventual expulsion from the party, and then the country, came the political execution of Kamenev and Zinoviev followed by their actual execution.

The creation of the National Health Service made it possible for the first time in British history for any citizen regardless of class, economic circumstance or location to feel assured that if they became ill they would receive free medical care of a usually high standard. This universalism underpinning the NHS ended the demoralization felt by those working class people using services without paying a fee, and broadly ended the disenchantment felt by those middle-class tax payers who hitherto this point saw a portion of their money go away to help the sustenance of those of whom they had no affinity to.

Public prosecutors are a central feature of this phase, considered as ""the gateway"" to criminal justice; they play a crucial role in crime control, enforcement and punishment, as will become apparent. Prosecutors in various jurisdictions possess widely different powers, yet all seemingly comply with due process rights under the ECHR. Independence of prosecution is of paramount importance. All jurisdictions claim to have independent prosecution services, yet the way they are conceptualised as such, varies extensively.

BAWE,BAWE_43,Why are people's memories influenced by their feelings?,"It has long been recognised that emotions exert powerful effects on memory, and that what we feel can strongly influence what we remember. The types of effects that emotion can have on memory differ markedly, depending on the precise conditions of encoding and retrieval (Eich, Kihlstrom, Bower, Forgas & Miedenthal, 2000). Differences in emphasis during encoding, for example, can have a profound effect on how, or indeed whether, information is remembered later (Gleitman, 1999) and similarly, the emotional state of a person at the time of retrieval may influence what they remember. Two central questions have arisen out of the study of the impact of emotion on memory; firstly, whether emotion increases or decreases the strength of memory for an event, and secondly, whether special mechanisms are required to account for the effects of emotion on memory (Eich et al, 2000). This essay will examine ways in which people's memories are affected by their feelings, and will also investigate models put forward as explanations as to why emotion has such an influence on memory.

Phillips demonstrated an inverse statistical association between annual changes in average wage rates and the unemployment. From the observation, Phillips found that one stable curve represented the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. During the late 1950s and the 1960s, many economists repeated Phillips's procedures examining inflation and unemployment data from a number of other industrialized countries, in many cases finding a negative relationship between the two variables. The negative empirical relationship between unemployment and inflation is known as the Phillips curve.

Discuss in relation to Cyprus and Mallorca.,"Recently dates for the human occupation of islands in the Mediterranean have been pushed back from around the 6 th millennium BP to the 9 th millennium BP by new evidence. This evidence claims to place human material culture in contexts containing bones of fauna previously thought to be extinct. Arguments as to whether these faunal extinctions can be attributed to human colonisation in some way have therefore arisen. Arguments relating to these extinctions have originally centered on the climatic changes that characterise the final stages of the Pleistocene and early Holocene. The following essay will attempt to lay out the evidence from several island studies relating to faunal extinctions and discuss their reliability and implications. The islands I will be looking at are Mallorca in the Western Mediterranean and Cyprus in the East. I will also look at possible patterns in the differences in extinction rates between islands in the East and the West and whether this can be related to the differences in their colonisation.

BAWE,BAWE_427,What are the consequences of 'eating badly' and whose responsibility is it if people do?,"One's first question might well be to ask what really is 'eating badly'? This is not as easy as one might assume because nutritional advice is constantly changing. For example, at one time all fats were considered 'bad' and should therefore be reduced in the diet, whereas now we are told that many are in fact necessary for good health (Lupton, 1996, p.76). In addition many people have more individualised concepts of what constitutes 'good' and 'bad' food. People see food in terms of how it makes them feel, thus one person might consider salad 'good' because it makes them feel cleansed, whereas another's definition might be a 'hearty' fried breakfast. A study by Calnan (1987) provides evidence, showing that while middle-class women broke down their foods into components in order to decide whether they were good or bad, working-class women were more concerned with simply having three solid meals a day (cited in Lupton, 1996, pp81-83). However, in order to tackle this essay, a definition is essential.

It centres on Deianeira, a female character who though not weak, is one of the most feminine and virtuous tragic heroines. Women were usually represented through Athenian drama either as strong and powerful characters, maddened by the conflict of their passions, and driven by revenge (for example Medea in Euripides' Medea, or Clytemnestra in Aeschylus' Agamemnon). Or as more docile models of the traditional expectations of women (such as Chrysothemis in Sophocles' Electra) who are tragically flawed with the natural defect of femininity (Phaedra in Euripides' Hippolytus).

At the foremost the ordering of society in the context of the Enlightenment led to a direct conflict between rationality and empiricism that resulted in a gender discourse within medicine. The growth of women's madness and the victimisation of women for the gains of the profession were exemplified in the changing conceptual understandings of gender. The medical profession provides a key illustration of an area where Victorian ideas on domesticity were reinforced, and had significant affects on the participation of class and genders in this field. The rise of the profession can been seen as reinforcing existing ideas, especially the prevalence of Enlightened ideas and Victorian domesticity, and additionally establishing new ideas that were consequential in the reinforcement of both class and gender divisions within society. The rise of professional medicine was arguably fuelled by ideas of the Enlightenment. This change resulted in significant affects on both the position of women in the community and had remifications for the class system.

Article 36 'Principles and Objectives', paragraph 1a of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ¹, states that 'the contracting parties [should] recall that the basic objectives of this Agreement include the raising of standards of living and the progressive development of the economies of all contracting parties.' However, there is a degree of flexibility, relating to the rules and regulations that govern the operation of the WTO, which can be exercised when a WTO member is facing the burden of anti-competitive measures (e.g. dumping) or the undesirable sourcing of supplies (that violate international environmental agreements) by other WTO members. These remedies will be considered in this essay. (Note: An important assumption made in this essay is that 'State A' is classed as a developed country and therefore cannot use special measures to promote their trade and development, which developing countries are entitled to do under Article 36.

BAWE,BAWE_691,Can we think nature's rights outside the anthropocentric outlook of the dominant discourse of human rights?,"<heading>Introduction</heading>In this essay I will try to assess whether it is possible, within the current Western framework, to think of a theory of natural-nonhuman rights. Does the anthropocentric dimension of our Western civilization allow us to think of natural-nonhumans as rights holders? Can the consumptive and exploitative structure of the Western model of life, which considers development as against nature, shift to a preservationist one? The emergence of the concepts of sustainable development in international law can be seen as a first step towards this end. But these notions are still focused on the well-being of the human species: sustainable development, the conservation of natural resources and wilderness for its needs are the concern of the current environmental policies. The preservation of the environment per se is not taken into account. We need an environmental ethic based on a rational theory which thinks the ways to live in harmony with our environment. Is the language of rights the appropriate one or should we shift to another one, an environmental rationale? The first section envisages the origins of the Western conception of nature and assesses its implications in the dominant discourse of human rights.

To do this, the essay will discuss the global women's movement, and explore women's movements in a national context. It will then discuss the differences within the women's movements, applying global arguments to Uganda. The essay will examine the key concepts of ethnicity and class, and analyse their roles within women's movements using case studies from Uganda. Furthermore, it will attempt to identify the factors that led to successful mobilization and draw lessons from relevant strategies adopted. Finally, it will recommend strategies for future engagements leading to successful mobilization towards women's empowerment. <heading>Definition of key concepts</heading>To answer the question effectively, it is important to define the key concepts, which are, class, ethnicity, women's movement and social change.

Svevo was a businessman that wanted to improve his English, and Joyce was his teacher.

How strong is the evidence for this alleged superiority?,"The idea that one can establish whether the German system of vocational education and training (VET) is superior to its British counterpart rests on a number of fallacious assumptions: Firstly, it assumes that the two systems are directly comparable, with the logical inference being that the vocational systems of both countries emerged in hermetically sealed environments, devoid of any wider social or historical context. This of course is an untenable position to hold. The German dual system rests on the firm foundations of its centuries-old guild tradition and it is sustained by Germany's manufacturing-based, export-led ""coordinated market economy"" (Soskice and Hall). The UK on the other hand possesses neither such a strong guild tradition nor the corporatist institutions which make the German VET system so fitting. Ours is a more ""liberal market economy,"" (Soskice and Hall) based more on the service industry and the production of low-quality goods which requires an altogether different model of voluntary education. Secondly, the question posits that the effects of the two countries' VET on their respective labour markets and respective economies at large are ascertainable. This necessitates the impossible task of isolating the effects of the voluntary education system from all other factors. To...",You are a university student.

Children are considered inhabitants of a world inundated by mass media (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002). A controversial issue is when the content of the viewed material contains violence and aggression. The frequency of this content in television programmes and in films was quantified concisely by Browne and Hamilton-Giachritsis (2005). Results from the UNESCO Global Television Violence study show that 61% of programmes investigated contained violence, 55% of which portrayed violence in a realistic setting. They also report that in 71% of these instances, characters showed no remorse for their actions and received no criticism for them. 42% of aggressive acts reported were associated with humour. Over 1000 violent murders, rapes and assaults are shown on television each year (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002). These statistics are worrisome when viewed in light of two theoretical approaches. The first is Bandura's social learning theory, which has given impetus to the television violence debate.

BAWE,BAWE_646,The Use of LCMS in Industry,"Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) is a rapidly growing analytical technique. The combination of two analytical techniques provides far more information than using each separately. LCMS can provide a chromatographic trace of a sample, on par with HPLC, along with the mass spectra of each fraction of the sample. This can provide essential structural information on compounds in the sample without having to isolate them and analyse them separately. One of the most important aspects of LCMS is the interface between the liquid chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. Mass analysis requires the analyte to be in the form of gaseous ions within a vacuum. However, liquid chromatography requires the analyte to be neutral and in solution at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, there are three main aspects important to each type of LCMS interface: evaporation, pressure reduction and ionisation. The evaporation of the eluent from the LC is required to convert the analyte from the liquid to the gas phase. The pressure reduction is required to create the low pressures or vacuum needed. Ionisation converts the neutral analyte molecules to ions. Different interfaces deal with these three issues in different ways and in different orders, with each with its own advantages and...",You are a university student.

Objects from this time are rarely preserved, due to the decomposition of artefacts. One way of gathering information is through the understanding of Burial rites. These burials are open to much interpretation and are not able to give information on all aspects of life at this time. Burials can show how the people of the time wished to express their society in the areas of hierarchy, ethnicity and gender distinctions. We also get information about immigration and trade. Burial rites are mostly shaped by the religious views of the society so the burials could give a representation of the theology. Changes in burial rites at the end of this time could show the rise of Christianity. Within Britain in both early and late cemeteries, cremation and inhumation were practiced simultaneously. Inhumations were generally single, extended bodies with grave goods, however there was great variation. These grave goods are clothing and objects buried with the body. Cremations mainly took the form of an urn filled with the ashes and not fully cremated bone. These bone fragments were, in most cases, placed in anatomical order.

Each poem looks at the ways in which 'acceptable' or traditional language practices can be altered. Although the poems both share the same theme, the poets approach the subject matter in very different ways. Petrucci explores, through the use of poeclectics, how traditional forms can be manipulated to the point where the meaning is altered. In contrast to this almost celebratory approach, Questel looks at how such manipulations of language can be rejected and oppressed. Poeclectics, as defined by Petrucci, is a growing tendency for poets to ""utilise more freely...a variety of texts, styles, voices, registers and forms"". It is ""a re-orientation towards Re-Writing that re-emphasises the conventional re-visitation of literature's more recognisable 'voices'.""

It will further consider the standardisation of leisure choices and the McDonaldization thesis to explain the dissemination of class structure within society and the importance of other measures, such as lifestyle, to re-define class. Leisure has become an important aspect of life regardless of the factors that influence choice. Haywood et al (1995) state that leisure may be what is done after all other duties have been completed, or a measure to achieve an aim within society hence being seen as why it is applied, rather than what actions define it. It can also be regarded as a goal, therefore emphasising on independence and the ability to choose leisure as a form of personal development.

The Way of Seeming provides us with an explanation of the sensible data available to us, even if it is not the truth and fallible. If Parmenides just wrote the Way of Truth he would be left with little else to explain as the Way of Truth leads us to rejecting our senses in favour of a reasoning that is far detached from the world.

BAWE,BAWE_394,In what sense might Metropolis and Der blaue Engel be considered 'modernist'?,"Modernism is surely the most indefinable movement of the twentieth century. As critics have remarked, it is a concept which 'incorporates major contradictions'. However, a key factor in our understanding of modernism is an awareness of the socio-political, cultural and scientific context of its conception. If we are to define it as a movement which, as Peter Childs argues, was 'primarily located in the years 1890-1930', then there are many notable developments which took place in Germany during this period crucial to the birth of modernism. Indeed, death contributed greatly to this birth. According to one website, '1,773,000' soldiers died and '11,000,000 mobilized' and '4,216,000 injured' men arrived home in the defeated Germany in 1914. More positively, the 1919 National Constitutional Assembly elections led to the 'right to vote' being given to women, who, six years later, represented over a third of the working population. Moreover, female emancipation occurred not only in political and professional realms, but also in the sphere of sexual relationships.

It is used to describe time and therefore has the same qualities as time i.e. a past, a present and a future. In English, this expression of time is a property of a verb form. In this essay I will discuss the possibility that it is not as simple as this. Tense could in fact be a matter of syntax. It could be a grammatical feature that is independent of time. Syntax is ""the way in which words are arranged to show relationships of meaning within (and sometimes between) sentences"" (Crystal 1997:94) I shall discuss whether it is possible to have a future time without a future tense.

Seymer Thompson provides an excellent summary of the reasons for this. It was obvious that parents were incapable of instilling virtue in their offspring, since 'great fathers sometimes had feeble sons, good fathers vicious sons, wise fathers silly sons.' (xxviii) While certain things could be communicated - by the ordinary arts, one assumes that Thompson means things like habits or mannerisms - but where virtue 'that vaguely-apprehended something that made one man count for more than another' (xxviii) was concerned, the actions of parents and guardians had little effect. At about the same time, a class of men emerged who claimed to 'fill the gap that home-training obviously left.' (xxviii) Opinion was divided in Ancient Athens over these Sophists, with the older generations cursing them and the younger praising. Their claim to teach virtue was crucial, for if, as it emerged, the Sophists appeared unsuccessful in their task, it could be for one of two reasons.

As Charles E Merriam rightly argues: the ""nature of power must be reconsidered from time to time in the light of the trends of social organization and of the human intelligence playing upon it"". The disadvantages of identifying an essence of a given topic have often been argued. My main objection to it, is that the effects may lead us to constrain the way we think about the topic. In this particular instance, we may find we are unable to reassess the issue of political power objectively and to approach it in new and more helpful ways.

The advantages of a hoplite phalanx over other contemporary fighting styles were that it ensured soldiers would fight with order, discipline and follow strict fighting tactics - due to this making survival much more likely. Tracing the development, nature and consequences of hoplites is made difficult by there being a limited amount of conclusive evidence, therefore interpretations must rely on what is available. When studying the development of the hoplite style, the major question is how the transition was brought about - whether heavy armour made possible the phalanx, or the introduction of the phalanx pressed the need for armour. A key factor in deciding this argument is to assess why the hoplite phalanx was able to develop in the seventh century and not before. This seems to be due to the state of the Greek economy, which allowed the armour for the hoplites to be built on a mass scale. Oswyn Murray states ""By...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_165,To what extent does the reduction in the number of elected union representatives in the French workplace reflect a decline in union influence?,"Trade union representation in the workplace is currently being debated in France as some union confederations, namely the CGT and CFDT, and employers question the existing framework of representation in the light of whether it weakens trade union legitimacy in the workplace (Hege 2000). This is an important topic because workplace legitimacy may help increase support for the unions and encourage collective bargaining that is more effective. Trade union support tends to be measured by membership levels, which are low in France (Visser 2000). It is difficult, however, to use this measurement as a reflection of union support as incentives to join a trade union are low. Firstly, the presumed representative status of the main union confederations means that workers, members and non-members, will benefit from collective agreements. Secondly, workers perceive that state intervention will bring about improvements in working conditions rather than collective bargaining (Milner 1999). This is just one example of an ambiguous interpretation of union influence which, in this case, leads to an underestimation (Jeffreys 1996b).

These developments were bolstered by a pervasive lauding of consumption, in marked contrast to the frugality and emphasis on production of the immediate past. Within a burgeoning consumerist culture, women were the focus of an advertising industry promoting a multitude of modern conveniences. Whilst female consumer prominence was potentially empowering, the mass media overwhelmingly advocated women's retreat to a private, domesticated sphere. Coinciding with the post-war rise in suburban housing and population growth, women came to suffer great pressure to aspire to a housewife ideal. Bolstered by the development of the highway system and availability of automobiles, the suburban exodus reaffirmed conventional gender roles upon a generation of young people. This racial paradigm left no room for those deviating from its stringent criteria, ostracising at once migrating African-American families excluded by segregation.

We can see from the film how the need to adapt ancient classics for a modern audience in order to make them both understandable and appropriate for modern standards will virtually always prevent the original story from being told without some changes to its content. The way that Satyricon uses various sources and Fellini's interpretation of them shows us how cinematic history can have similar methodology to literary history, which could be used to argue for the legitimacy for a cinematic presentation of history. Satyricon also shows how valuable the visual element of presenting ancient Rome can be, since it can show us differences between antiquity and modern society that could not be put across in words.

This question is plagued by the elusive notion of community, which reflects the intellectual struggle between the nostalgic calling for returning to traditional communities and the attempts to acknowledge new forms of social solidarity by re-conceptualizing community. Identifying the inevitable subjective element in every definition of community, I found it a genuine aptitude not to impose any a priori criteria of community in studying the social life in cyberspace, but rather focusing on the CMC user's subjective interpretation. Based on the empirical evidence available, I found: (a) CMC users can indeed use this medium constructively in maintaining some sort of social life from which they can obtain a 'sense of community' (b) However, to claim that such community exist 'in cyberspace' is misleading.

However, pioneering research into quality of life concluded that personal income exerts little influence over subjective well-being (Easterlin, 1974; & Campbell et al., 1976). Subsequent reviewers have arrived at similar conclusions (Headey and Wearing, 1989; & King and Napa, 1998). This has encouraged cognitive psychologists to develop theories in order to explain these findings. Recent approaches attempt to enable us to better predict the circumstances under which money can make a person happier. I intend to outline three key findings involving conflicting evidence from economists and psychologists: Why there is little increase in happiness as national wealth rises. Why richer nations do not appear to be happier than poorer nations. Why there appears to be a tendency for richer people within a community to be happier than poorer people.

His knowledge of theology was based on the Roman Catholic interpretation of it. In 1917 he produced his 95 theses, yet 'opinions vary as to how well developed Luther's theology was' by this stage. What began as an attack 'against the abuses associated with Tetzel's indulgence peddling' became a condemnation of the papacy.

Many wish to maintain that a God that is personal and interacts with the world must be located, in some way, within space and time, whilst others claim that the classical qualities of omnipotence and omniscience are compromised when God is bound, and arguably limited, by temporal and spatial constraints. In particular, arguments for the existence of God that posit an unmoved mover, first cause and omnipotent creator of the universe, arguably, require that God is not limited by spatial and temporal constraints; as this may limit His creative abilities enough to postpone the creation of the universe, and thus His existence.

From Dolly the Sheep, to the more recent engineering of tissue from patient's cells to reconstruct (and subsequently re-implant) damaged bladders (Chung, 2006), it seems that medical science is increasingly pushing back the boundaries of possibility, and reconfiguring our understandings of the human body, and its potential for manipulation .

As a result, the major changes in the international economy are heavily linked to this since the World War created a huge amount of destruction both physical and human. One of the main immediate impacts of war was the abandonment of the Gold Standard as governments monetised debt by selling bonds to their central banks. This among other factors led to inflation, which created immense instability. Governments therefore wished to get back on the Gold Standard as it was seen as a symbol of prosperity; a tool to revive international trade and restore stability that the floating exchange rates had destroyed. However, there were a number of differences that meant the inter-war Gold Standard did not work as well as the pre war Gold Standard that shall be explained in this essay.

BAWE,BAWE_228,Poetry and Society: 1500-word close reading exercise of 'The Badger' by John Clare.,"At the start of his literary career Clare had forged for himself the poetic identity of the 'Northamptonshire peasant poet.' It was a persona that bestowed its author with celebrity status and was also a principle factor in the popularity of his collections. 'The Badger' was written when public fascination with the labourer-poet had begun to wane. A series of increasingly diminutive returns from his publications and imminent detention at a sanatorium were events that vitally contextualise the poem. Clare constructs 'The Badger' around the struggles of it's eponymous protagonist, and the badger itself suggests possible commensuration with both the author and the labouring classes to which Clare belonged. This is the central interpretive dilemma of the poem: should we read 'The Badger' as political allegory or personal biography? The poem can be viewed primarily as a metaphor of rural displacement; the badger emblematic of a countryside Everyman expatriated from his natural surroundings and forced into the violent competition of the towns. The consequence is either death or servitude, the ""baited badger"" (l.55) of the final stanza symbolic of the country-folk assimilated into an urban regime and relegated to menial social function.

BAWE,BAWE_104,Was European Imperialism a violation or an integral component of liberal ideology?,"European imperialism in the pre-World War era appears aggressive, coercive and plainly exploitative. Indeed, it seems antithetical to liberalism that is embedded on the principles of self-determination, autonomy and individual freedom. However, this incongruity between nineteenth century European metropolitan theory and non-European colonialisation has been accurately accounted for by neo-Marxists such as Lenin. The 'Highest stage of capitalism' theory emphasises that the annexation of exotic territory was influenced purely by economic needs, as imperialism was essential for the very survival of capitalism; the acquisition of materials such as rubber, copper, sugar, tea and diamonds would elevate the income of the rising bourgeois and the proletariat and keep domestic public discontent down to a minimum, an idea amplified by advocates of the social imperialism theory. Interestingly, this interpretation is suggestive of a crucial point: that imperialism is not a direct contradiction of liberalism but liberalism itself is paradoxical. As Raymond Williams highlights, it is a 'doctrine based on individualist theories of man and society' and thus implies that individuals are politically equal, but have the freedom to be economically dissimilar; theoretically, a strange blend of universality and differentiation. This mixture is also the bedrock of imperialism; the phenomena was not just...",You are a university student.

The competitions did not only take place in the city of Rome, but were instead held throughout the empire, even in the small towns. The fighting was carried out in amphitheatres, large and significant structures that could hold the majority of a town's population.

In order to answer 'yes', we must arrive at a concept of personhood that remains distinct from the body. Whatever it is that comprises this 'person' can be transferred into a new body and still retain its identity as the same person. If, however, we can only define personhood in such a way that relies, even partly, on a physical body then any such swap will be impossible without changing or destroying the original person and our answer will be 'no'. Locke and Williams both attempt to address this issue of personal identity. Locke's attempt at pinpointing personal identity relies on a consciousness with a continuation of memory, without reference to a body. Because of this he would answer 'yes' to the original question, and he even outlines such a situation involving a prince and a cobbler.

A psychological disorder can be defined as a dysfunction within an individual that is associated with distress or impairment in functioning and a response that is not typical. The behaviourist approach in psychology understands human behaviour as a consequence of conditioning. This approach claims that all human behaviour is shaped by reinforcement from the environment and the consequences of actions. Humans become conditioned to respond to our environment as a result of leaning by association or operant. Learning by association or classical conditioning is attributed to Ivan Pavlov and his theory of classical conditioning, while operant conditioning, or learning by way of reward and unpleasant consequence, is credited to BF Skinner. Operant conditioning states that all behaviour is a result of learning, of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement and punishment. (Skinner, B. F., 1974) Perhaps a person has been rewarded for doing exhibiting certain behaviour in the past and these acts as positive reinforcement and helps sustain the behaviour. Similarly, a person may have been told off for exhibiting a certain type of bad behaviour and these acts as punishment and a deterrent of such future behaviour.

Decision making consists of choosing from between various options and with each option there are generally associated benefits and costs. It used to be thought that people behave rationally and therefore would select what would rationally be the best option. This assumption is what normative theories of decision making were built upon, for example utility theory as proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern argues that we try to maximise expected utility, by assessing the probability of an outcome occurring and multiplying it by the utility (the subjective desirability) of that outcome. However it was soon realised that people do not make decisions in a rational manner and are often affected by factors other than expected utility (Eysenck & Keane, 2005). People tend to violate the criterion set by utility theory as they give more value to certain outcomes than to uncertain ones and also tend to have different attitudes towards gains and losses. To cope with this inconsistent data, new theories were developed such as prospect theory as put forward by Kahneman & Tversky, this theory proposes that peoples...",You are a university student.

Explain this statement, commenting on how English listeners tell the difference between voiced and voiceless obstruents in syllable initial and syllable final position.","<heading>Introduction</heading>In order to communicate successfully, speakers of English must be able to distinguish between the sounds of the language. For instance, they must be able to produce and hear the difference between minimal pairs such as tap and tab, or tap and bap. For these two pairs it is necessary for the listener to be able to distinguish between the bilabial plosives // and //. Affricates, fricatives and plosives are considered to be obstruents and they are thus called because during production there is an obstruction of the airflow in the nose or mouth which causes friction or closure (Giegerich 1995). They can be voiced or voiceless and so pairs can be distinguished by the absence or presence of vocal fold vibration. This can be said to explain how speakers of English distinguish between tap and tab, or tap and bap. However, in English 'phonologically voiced stops are rarely voiced phonetically, and when they are, they are very rarely fully voiced' (Shockey 2003: 30).

We will then see how, despite some apparently obvious and significant differences, at their core the two accounts are relatively similar. Kant begins by explaining that we are grammatically incorrect to label an object or phenomenon as sublime. The sublime instead lies within the subject, as an experience which arises out of a particular state of the mind; what we call the sublime object is the cause of this mental process. Kant separates these sublime experiences into two categories: the dynamical and the mathematical, and we shall address both of these in turn. We call those objects or phenomena in nature which cause an experience of the mathematically sublime when they evoke an idea of infinity within us; whether spatial or temporal. Something is mathematically sublime if it is 'absolutely great', or, in other words, without comparison. Classic examples include a vast plain, the sky at night or the Grand Canyon.

It is widely acknowledged that the public administrative structure of Hong Kong is constructed explicitly according to the Weberian ideal typical model of ""bureaucracy"" (Degolyer and Scott 1996, Lam 2005). The values which are attached to the ""Weberian bureaucratic model"" such as impartiality, cost-effectiveness and professionalism, have been widely accepted as the desirable values of the Hong Kong government, or even as the ""Hong Kong spirit"" in general. The ""Weberian bureaucracy"" stands for a guarantee of ""prosperity and stability"", which are the foundation of the city's development. In short, the ""Weberian bureaucracy"" is the model of governance that Hong Kong people are proud of and eager to uphold. However, the more I read about Weber, the more I found that the bureaucratic model embraced by the Hong Kong people does not depict the completed model as suggested by Weber.

This means setting prices according to the demand for a given period. In periods of low demand, customers can take advantage of lower prices, where as when demand is high, higher prices are charged (Ingold, McMahon-Beattie and Yeoman, 2000). However, it has been well documented that the process of yield management can be perceived to be unfair by the consumer, as they may be paying a different price to another consumer. Yield management is a practice that is fairly widely accepted in the airline industry (Kimes, 1994). Kimes believes that this is because the practice has been happening for longer in the airline industry. Customers of the hotel industry find it hard to accept the fairness of yield management, as they often cannot differentiate the products received by themselves and others who may be paying a different price (Kimes, 1994). When consumers pay for a product, they have a reference price for that product, which is the price that they perceive to be reasonable for the product they are receiving.

Reviewing the literature, it seems Evolutionary Psychologists call on Darwinian Theory of biological evolution - that the genes for physical properties which aid human survival will be passed on more than those that do not, because individuals possessing those genes are more likely to survive and reproduce - and apply this to psychological dispositions to think and behave today in terms of survival.

There are three major types of fiscal policy rules, balanced-budget or deficit rules, debt or reserves rules and borrowing rules. Balanced-budget or deficit rules require a balance between overall revenue and expenditure or limit on government deficit as a proportion of GDP. Borrowing rules prohibit government borrowing from domestic sources or the central bank. Debt or reserves rules limit the stock of gross (or net) government liabilities as a proportion of GDP.

BAWE,BAWE_819,A Comparative Analysis of Passages A and C,"This essay aims to analyse and compare the three opening paragraphs of Louise Erdrich's 'Tracks' (passage A) to 'Her First week' by Sharon Olds (passage C). Both texts can be defined as 20 th century American literature, although they differ in genre - the former is prose fiction and the latter is a poem. That said, the texts share a number of similarities. Both use techniques that are commonly found in other genres. For instance, prose is often thought of as 'non-poetic', but throughout the passage from Tracks are literary techniques such as alliteration, parallelism, metaphors and similes. In this sense the language of 'Tracks' does not fit the formal definition of prose fiction. Similarly, the form and language of the poem is perhaps closer to prose than poetry, due to the absence of end rhyme and a regular metrical pattern. Firstly, one of the most noticeable aspects of both texts is that they are mainly in past tense. Consequently, both use diegesis, a basic form of narration that concerns telling and recounting, as opposed to showing or enacting.

The approach of 'principled eclecticism' is looked at from within a specific context, focusing on conditions necessary for learning that can be enhanced by the teacher in any situation.

It is a simple way of representing the values of the forces which drive the electrical particles: FORMULA This integral is taken over every particle inside the body under consideration, which can be of any form as long as the distribution of charge is fixed. Here p' (x', y', z') is a particle inside the body with corresponding charge density ρ', volume dx'dy'dz' and hence ρ'dx'dy'dz' represents the quantity of electricity it contains. p (x, y, z) is a point outside the body and r' = √((x'-x)²+(y'-y)²+(z'-z)²) is the distance between p and p'.(See Appendix Fig 1).

Connections here refer to the economic, political and intellectual interaction between the flourishing trading economies of Western Europe and Asia during the centuries that served as a pre-requisite to the Industrial Revolution in Europe since the late 18 th century, and colonisation and servitude in Asia. To outline the main stages of the connection briefly, we can say that before C15 it amounted to European explorations, between C15 and C16 it consisted of a two way trading system with the balance of payments heavily in the red for Europe, between C16 and C18 we see European political authority on Asian soils starting to sprout and shaping trading policies likewise and after C18 we see an outright occupation of Asia with its economy being channelled to benefit that of the colonial metropolis.

Towards this end, it is interesting to note Hamber and van der Merwe's identification of at least five different understandings of the concept of reconciliation in South Africa, non-racial, intercommunal, religious, human rights, and community building; these ideologies may comfortably co-exist, but have been at the core of conflict between different groups during the process of the TRC. This theory is useful in our present context as it provides the basis of one of the ways in which the various grounds of criticisms levelled against the TRC may be categorised. The dissatisfaction that a particular individual, group or institution might express towards the work of the TRC, based upon its predominant ideology of reconciliation, does not necessarily translate into dissatisfaction with the performance of the TRC but possibly with one or more of the principles that it bases itself upon, such as its use of the language of Christian forgiveness, to name just one example. <fnote>Borer, Tristan Anne,...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_193,Critically Evaluate the Evidence that Different Stages of Sleep Aid Different Types of Learning.,"Studies have shown that the amount of REM sleep increases after learning something new, and that deprivation of REM sleep reduces the capacity to learn (Rosenzweig, 1999). However, conflicting results show that the type of learning influences whether it is REM sleep alone that aids the learning, or whether other stages also play a role. For example, more recent studies suggest that stage two sleep plays a role in motor learning. Other studies have even given conflicting results about how the effects of implicit and explicit learning relate to the role of REM sleep. Ultimately methodological problems with studies investigating sleep and learning, mean it is not completely clear which different stages of sleep aid different types of learning. The relationship between REM sleep and learning has been demonstrated in a variety of different studies.

What, if anything, is wrong with it?","It is rare that you'll find a discussion group in which the morality of paedophilia is a topic which will divide the opinions of its members. The media and social hype which surrounds the subject leaves little room for an unbiased and constructive debate. This is perhaps justly deserved, for in most cases acts of paedophilia involve the subjection of minors to physical and psychological abuse which can have severely detrimental effects on the rest of that individuals life. It is also true that the acts often occur in relationships which are dependant on an implicit trust, such as the relationship between a carer and child. The performance of an act of paedophilia in such a relationship represents an extreme betrayal of this trust, and thus cannot be perceived as anything but immoral. However, any objective moral account of paedophilia requires the separation of an act of paedophilia from the wrongdoing which often occurs simultaneously with that act. Only upon an investigation into the nature of paedophilia in itself can we assess its morality. Before discussing the morality of paedophilia, we must first identify what an act of paedophilia actually entails. Primoratz (1999) distinguishes between pederasty, ephebophilia and paedophilia.

Lay people's beliefs about health are different from that of the medical profession because they do not have formal medical qualifications or training. During recent years the term lay beliefs has shifted to lay knowledge, belief implies that is not based on sound fact or evidence and may be wrong whereas knowledge is more factual and systematic. This shift has led to the debate which will be discussed in this essay, the extent to which this is true, that it is no longer just the medical profession who have the medical knowledge. In this essay I will firstly examine how lay concepts of health and illness are in fact lay, using examples from studies and I will then discuss the extent to which lay concepts of health and illness are not as lay as they may seem.

This cause was the defiance of Tyranny. If this is coupled with the fact that this same period contained some of the most famous and terrible tyrants in history then it is unsurprising that some were ready to die to depose them. The purpose of this essay is to explore the reasons why some men would willingly lose their lives to oppose such tyrants as Nero and the Flavian emperors Domitian and Vespasian. This essay will show the philosophical and traditional reasoning as to why some defied them, as well as illustrating how some of these emperors facilitated this resistance to their own rule. There are several cases of learned or aristocratic men opposing emperors for their beliefs. However before I discuss those I will firstly look at the Senate in the early Principate.

Why do some not do so?,"Much more reproductive choice is now available to women, with the ability to chose whether or not to have children, when to have them and in what context, now a reproductive right given to women. This, combined with shifting social and economic opportunities for women, has lead to an increase in the number of childless women, with, in 1991, twice as many saying that they expected to remain childless as in 1986 (Gillespie, 2001). However the anticipated number of children per woman in Europe and the USA is still near or above two (Bongaarts, 1999), showing that many are still having children. In this essay I will explore why women have children, even though there is now more opportunity for them not to, and why those who do not have children do not do so. I will begin by looking at why women do have children, exploring the idea of push and pull in the decision, introduced by Morrell (1994), looking at factors identified as 'pulling' women into motherhood; psychological, social and economic factors, as well as looking at the influences of 'push' factors such as national discourses on motherhood and social policy.

Popularity (defined as ""being liked or supported by many people"") is ultimately determined by a president's personality, and can go some way to ensuring elections are won, economic growth is encouraged, and misdemeanour is forgotten. Roosevelt, for example, is famed for his ""fireside chats"" during a period of economic turmoil and Clinton's presidency continues to be celebrated by many despite personal and political problems. In the short term, therefore, character determines popularity and hence how successful a president is perceived to be due to media influence and interaction with the public. Yet popularity alone does little to explain the prevalence of presidents such as Washington and Lincoln, whose personalities are long forgotten, in twenty-first century rankings of successful presidents. Nor does it explain why some presidents, whose popularity was high throughout their time in office such as Theodore Roosevelt, are little- known for being great today.

Throughout the 1990s the US was performing strong in terms of economy, but recently there has been a downturn. Especially the year 2001 was difficult, because the financial markets were suffering of lack of confidence and terrorist attacks further deepened the problem. Yet, there have not been any significant signs of recovery, even though it can be argued that there are prospects for a good economic year 2005 in the US. Nevertheless, oil price is a factor that can endanger the positive development in the economy and in can pose a problem in the trade deficit that the country struggles with. In addition, weak dollar might further deepen this difficulty. The uncertainty of the US economy is reflected on the other economies of the world, particularly on the Asian ones, but Euro Area has suffered from the fluctuations as well.

Emphasis thereby is often laid on his concept of a 'general will', through which personal liberty is handed over to the collective. 'The citizens having but one interest', Rousseau argues, 'the people [have] but a single will'. And although Rousseau favours the ballot vote, he argues for the infallibility of its ruling: 'when the opinion contrary to my own prevails, it proves nothing more than that I made a mistake, and that what I took to be the general will was not'. From the point of view of Rousseau, most importantly protection should be rendered against the emergence of a minority rule, or 'particular will', rather than against the state, which, after all, represents the sovereignty of the lawgiver as it corresponds with the community's best interest, the general will. The question I will look at here is thus to what extent the critical assertion holds truth that 'the more safeguards he established against despotism, the more weapons he forged for tyranny', within Rousseau's system of the social...","You are a university student.

A few other gods managed to make it out of their home country as cult figures (e.g. Cybele, Mithras and the amalgam that was Serapis), but no other achieved such universality. The Greek, Macedonian and finally Roman influence on the country of Egypt is finally what allowed her name to be heard abroad, but what was it about Isis that made her particularly appealing? In this essay I would like to discuss several concepts surrounding this question. Isis' origins as an Egyptian goddess do not necessarily reflect that which she became. Egypt itself was never as unified in its concepts of religion as the Greek city-states were; throughout the country gods and goddesses were identified with different aspects of each other and with different animals. There were three main schools of Egyptian religion, centring in Memphis, from Hermopolis and from Heliopolis.

Natural science studies the natural world in a fashion where there are finite answers. Studying Management in this manner may succeed in explaining what managers do and the work they perform, but may fail to address the nature and causes of human behaviour at an organizational level. Therefore, there should be an acknowledgement of the limitations that arise when trying to approach the study of Management using natural scientific techniques. When organisations adopt these techniques, their strategies become more rational, more productive and efficient and there is an inclination towards scientific management. While the organisation may be very competent and profitable, the workforce's skills and satisfaction may be endangered.

When determining house prices a number of things have to be taken into consideration, such as supply and demand of many different factors, interest rates, population change and movement, construction and production: all of which vary in impact. The economic model of supply and demand, developed by Antoine Augustin Cournot, 1883, attempts to describe, explain and predict changes in the price and quantity of goods sold in competitive markets. It describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between a products availability at each price, the supply, and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price, the demand. This concept applied to house prices show that demand and supply have a huge impact. Land is finite resource as there is only a given amount of in each country.

At the time Waterland was released, New Historicism and Poststructuralism dominated literary criticism. However, during the 1990s, criticism turned towards ethics, therefore, newer readings of Swift's novel devote themselves to the ethical and psychological considerations of Waterland. I aim to cover this wide range of readings and interpretations. In one of the earliest readings of Waterland, Del Ivan Janik pinned down the three main threads of history the novel develops: history as inquiry, as a subject and as stories. These three sides of the same theme have led to multiple interpretations and readings in the light of postmodernism, trauma studies or advocacy criticism. In 'The Novels of Graham Swift', Tamás Bényei states that literary criticism of Swift's novels either tends to study what Linda Hutcheon names ""historiographic metafiction"" and predominantly looks at Waterland, or, review of all of his novels, focusing on mourning and melancholia.

This is undoubtedly an unprecedented figure. The war consumed civilians, military personnel, landscapes and cites whilst the aftermath can still be felt today. The end of the war in May 1945 marked a distinct turning point as the survivors befell victim to psychological trauma which resulted in a collective trauma for European societies.

What sort of a hero he is however is an issue of debate. Virgil chose his main character of the poem as Aeneas, a Trojan from a Greek epic. While this gave his poem (written a great deal later than the works of Homer) a degree of credibility, it also left him with the problem of fitting a character with features of a Greek hero into a poem that was intended to be the defining Roman epic. Virgil manages to use this conflict to his advantage, to advance the plot and develop Aeneas' character, giving the story an emotional depth and resonance. The ways in which Aeneas the hero is characteristically Roman also reflect the underlying purpose of the Aeneid; to promote the greatness of Rome and Virgil's patron, the Emperor Augustus.

The acquired language disorder literally translates as the total loss of language function, despite patients not necessarily losing all of their language abilities (Carlson et al, 2004: 388)., and has been found to be the result of damage to the brain and nervous system (Obler, 1999: 1). Libben states that ""the study of aphasia is the most important tool in the investigation of language and the brain"" (1996: 424) with many types of aphasia being identified in recent years spanning all modalities of language. Aphasia is split into two main groups, the fluent and the non-fluent syndromes with fluency being categorised as the ability to express five or more words uninterrupted (Goodglass, 2001: 67). Non-fluent and fluent syndromes demonstrate very different symptoms and are thought to be the result of different injuries.

However, a decent analyse should not be based on such a division. Even just a glance at the poem allows to perceive a typographic break in the middle of the poem (l.14). The lines are shorter. Then, reading the poem (and it is even more obvious when listening to it) confirms this feeling as the syntax changes; that is why it is interesting to analyse how each part works, starting by the first one.

The novel has a set of narrative procedures which are instantly recognisable and these procedures create a regulated structure for the novel which does not exist so strongly in other literary forms, such as the play. The genre of the play is naturally a freer form, with more scope for expression and interpretation as there is not such a strict structure. An actor portraying a character can choose to interpret a character in a number of ways, whereas characters in a novel are more regulated by structure and form.

What is perhaps most ambiguous is what structural adjustment aims for, recently it has been used as a development tool were initially it sought more to implement macroeconomic reform. In assessing the economic merits of structural adjustment alongside its drawbacks I hope to look beyond the circumstantial evidence to the theoretical frameworks which surround its creation. My argument will focus on the socio-political effects of structural adjustment in contrast to its economic advantages using the evidence from countries (Peru and Zimbabwe specifically) who have experienced structural adjustment as well as purveying the academic literature, especially that of NGO's, assessing the validity of structural adjustment as a tool of development and the different recommendations for its future.

The debate concerning the EU's legitimacy is generally centred on two main normative conceptions of governance in Europe. Firstly, the ardently supranational, state-centric approach, which attacks the legitimacy of the Union for lacking the qualities that constitute liberal-democratic nation states - the only truly legitimate political organisation in European thought to hold the allegiance of the masses. And, secondly, the functional, regulatory-type, multi-level governance approach that criticises the EU's dubious legitimacy since it has ventured beyond rational, pragmatic association and clashed with the nation state. Overall, effective assessments of arguably the most crucial aspect of legitimacy - identity - are rare. From both perspectives, the establishment of a European identity which recognises the EU as a legitimate polity, either in the United States of Europe, federalist sense, or in the multi-level governance sense of rationally divided competencies between various levels of government, identity is critical. Without popular support and recognition the EU will remain in a state of limited legitimacy regardless of whether or not contingencies are made for popular...",You are a university student.

The objective of this research piece is to look at four stages of the life cycle. The four stages that will be referred to throughout the statistical analysis are: pre-family/no family (those that are aged under 45 who are not parents), family (those that are of any age with a least one child under the age of 16 still living at home), third age (those that are aged 45-64 with no children aged under 16) and retired (aged over 65 with no children aged under 16) (Mintel, 2004b). In academic literature Rapoport and Rapoport (1975) broke the life cycle down into four different stages: adolescence (search for personal identity), young adulthood (search for social identity), establishment (creating life investments) and retirement (searching for the meaning of life). Unfortunately the stages that Rapoport and Rapoport refer to are unable to support statistical research that has been carried out.

Indeed, qualitative research in itself has had difficulty in finding its place within psychological methodology, and continues to be considered by some as an unacceptable way of conducting objective research. In this essay, I aim to briefly consider the correct application for qualitative methods, and how objectivity can be maximised. Burt and Oaksford (1999) contrast the view of human nature and knowledge put forward by Morgan (1996, 1998, as cited by Burt & Oaksford, 1999) whereby science is seen as uncovering an objective, single truth about the world, and the postmodernist view of Stevenson and Cooper (1997, 1998, as cited by Burt & Oaksford, 1999), where knowledge is seen as constructivist in the face of no knowable objective truth. They conclude that the utility of a theory is not based on its objective truth, and also observe that psychology does not have the complexity of previous theoretical background that aids other sciences in their hypothesis formulation. So it would seem that qualitative research is the initial probe of psychological research, investigating the world in a way that can provide us with the information...","You are a university student.

Discuss.,"India's history has been frequently disrupted by the influence of famine, on average twice a century regions would be severely hit by an extreme shortage of food, resulting in mass casualties. However, from 1765 (which saw the British conquer Bengal) to 1900, there were approximately 17 major famines, a dramatic increase that was conflicting with the modernisation process associated with the period. Government policies were certainly significant in the development of these famines, but the roles of factors such as climate, over-population and social reaction should not be ignored. Once assessed against these reasons, the importance of the role a government plays can be accurately determined. Climate is perhaps the most appropriate place to start as it is undoubtedly at the origin of all shortages of food. The weather dictates the success of the harvest, which in turn determines how much food is available to distribute in the coming year. David Arnold highlights the role which climate plays: 'The history of famine in India, too, seems to substantiate the importance, if not the primacy, of climate. Every major famine of the nineteenth century was preceded by the partial, sometimes the complete, failure of the monsoon rains on which Indian agriculture...",You are a university student.

The sector as a whole is small: the Independent Schools Council (ISC) (n.d.) estimate that there are approximately 2,500 independent schools in the UK, catering for just seven per cent of the school-age population. It would thus be fair to ask why this educational minority attracts 'a level of public debate which is out of all proportion to their numerical significance' (Fox, 1984, p.45). One finds a likely solution in the extent to which these forms of schooling have been identified as offering a fundamentally different type of education. Chubb and Moe (1997, p.364) tell us that 'the organisation of schools is largely endogenous to the system of institutional control in which the schools are embedded.' This suggests that the different governing mechanisms experienced by the state and independent sectors must produce fundamentally distinct types of school.

The argument that France's trade union movement is ideologically and politically divided is widely discussed and sustained and this indicates the significance of the issue (Bridgford 1991; Boltansk 1999; Daley 1999; Lange et al 1982; Moss 1987; Mouriaux 1983; Schain 1987; Verberckmoes 1996; Visser 2000). It is important, firstly, because 'the study of inter-confederal relations is central to any understanding of French industrial relations' (Bridgford 1991:82) and secondly, because divisions in the union movement can have a negative impact on trade union membership (Bean 1994:41; Rehfeldt 1999), collective bargaining (Schain 1987), neo-corporatist industrial relations (Valenzuela 1992:76) and hence, the entire industrial relations system.

Employers' organisations (or associations) are described according to an EIRO comparative study as the 'bodies designed to organize and advance the collective interests that employers have in the labour market' (EIRO 2004:1, emphasis added).

The main feature of American hegemony in this period will be described as rapidly declining rather than ascending after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. That is, the retreat of the United States from the multilateral trade order caused by the domestic economic distress is addressed as a principal driving force toward market integration with the first major developing partner.

As a journalist, she strongly urged the government to grant women the vote and wrote many essays and articles on women's rights as unwed mothers, in the workforce and in education.

Storni's early poetical works undoubtedly portray a greatly ambitious woman who, not only dares to challenge society's expectations of her in her choice of lifestyle, but promotes her feminist ideas to the female public in the hope that they will perceive her as an inspirational leader. Her poetry illustrates a woman who resents society's creation of polarity between men and women and is keen to dissolve this imbalance by promoting feminist awareness.

BAWE,BAWE_184,"Theoretical models of consumer behaviour often stress the importance of perceived personal wealth, but models based on empirical data still rely heavily on the influence of current personal income. Why?","This essay discusses the consumer behaviour. Factors that influence consumption will be analysed firstly, following by comparison of current income with expected future income, with the help of empirical data. In addition, the different responses to expectation and current income on consumption will be examined with respect to certain groups. A conclusion will then be drawn. Consumption behaviour depends on disposable income Y d, i.e. income minus tax. The higher the disposable income, the higher the level of consumption. In addition, the level of financial wealth such as accumulative savings in the bank, the value of stocks and bonds owned, as well as housing wealth, play an important role in consumer's behaviour. The sum of financial wealth and housing wealth is defined as nonhuman wealth. In contrast, the sum of disposable income is called as human wealth. Therefore, the total wealth, which is the summation of human and nonhuman wealth, determines the consumption function. Assume that consumers maximize their consumption utility subject to a budget constraint that is total wealth. Over a lifetime, we will spend all of our total wealth on goods and services. Hence, the lifetime from year 0 to year N, consumption will equal to the sum...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_692,Four propositions to improve the efficiency of alternative globalization movements and civil society organizations,"<heading>Introduction</heading>In this study I will consider non-violent alternative globalization movements and civil society organizations as social movements. I will focus on movements from the South which challenge - in different ways - the very concept and nature of international law through their pragmatic struggles. These case-studies aim at grounding the four propositions I want to make in order to improve the efficiency of civil society activism. I mean to sketch general features applicable to a theory of social movements from the study of concrete cases. The first section assesses the 'Subaltern Cosmopolitan Legality' theory developed by Rajagopal. The second one draws lessons from the original structure of the World Social Forum and of the Zapatista network in order to identify the most desirable way to organize social movements at a global and local level. The third proposition, based on the 'transcalar' use of law in the Narmada Valley struggle and by the anti-sweatshop movement in Mexico, offers a set of strategies and methods that can make the work of social movements more effective. Finally the fourth proposition identifies the legal skills developed by the Movement of the Landless in its struggle against a hegemonic and neoliberal conception of private property...",You are a university student.

For this examination, it will primarily focus on three key characteristics of globalisation ; Increasing mobility of capital, the stagnation of multilateral liberalisation and the expansion of regionalism, emergence of transnational production chain. In particular, this essay emphasise the fact that unprecedented transnational production have changed the interpretation of traditional comparative advantage. The increase of global division of labour and the decrease of cross-border movement cost cause the diversification of investment and production priority. Following the priority change of decision on production and investment, the concept of traditional comparative advantage moves to more flexible type.

The United Kingdom, in much the same vein as other nations with similarly well-developed, complex and expansive market economies - the US, Australia and prominent EU Member States in particular - has acknowledged the importance of having such regulation and has for many years employed a system of merger control. The FTA 1973 provided the UK's statutory regime for 3 decades until, in 2002, the Enterprise Act was passed.

Subtleties aside, Quine denies the possibility of our beliefs being justified, in much the same way as our actions are sometimes denied ethical value. Thus, the traditional epistemic enquiry is all but drained of content, and Quine urges us to abandon the project altogether and turn to the empiric issue of how beliefs and theories about the outside world are generated in the human brain. In this essay I will try and outline Quine's project and his reasons for 'naturalizing epistemology'.

Simply speaking, it should be a combination of nation economies which are originally based on individual nation states. Then what is nation state? Basically, nation state refers to a national government, who has a unified administration on politics, economy, law and culture within the borders of a defined territory. However, the connotation of world economy is in fact much broader than a simple summation of nation economies, as it has been undergoing a profound transformation. One of the most popular terms used to characterise the world economy in current times is economic 'globalization', which means an internationally integrated market, within which businesses are operated as if national borders did not exist. As Ohmae (2000: 207) put it, 'in terms of real flows of economic activity, nation states have already lost their role as meaningful units of participation in the global economy of today's borderless world'. Therefore, a serious issue that globalization has resulted in the decline of nation state power has aroused worldwide concerns.

In a broad sense of the term, ethnicity is a term which represents social groups with a shared history, sense of identity, geography and cultural roots which may occur despite racial difference. It is often used to describe those who are of a minority in the country they live in, hence the term ethnic minority. There are higher rates of mental illness amongst minority ethnic groups in Britain, specifically diagnosed schizophrenia amongst Afro Caribbean men and somatization amongst female South Asian migrants (Annandale, 2000). The reasons for high rates of schizophrenia amongst Afro Caribbean men will be explored first. These statistics however, may not be due to actual differences but due to artefactual explanations. The ethnicity of the people is often determined by their place of birth even if this is not where they have spent most of their lives.

BAWE,BAWE_507,Are Socrates views on pleasures in the Protagoras and the Gorgias compatible?,"Socrates offers, at first glance, two contrasting accounts of pleasure in the Protagoras and the Gorgias. In the Protagoras, Socrates seems to advocate pleasure as the supreme good, perplexing the sophist with the notion that hedonism can be seriously considered as an acceptable way of life. Conversely, in the Gorgias, he passionately argues against Callicles' proposal that the ultimate good is achieved by one who creates and satisfies large and intense appetites. This controversy appears to make Socrates out to be a holder of opposing ideologies, offering contradictory accounts of the proper way one should live his life. The reasons for dispute are easy to determine. At Gorgias 495a-d Callicles equates pleasure with the good. At Protagoras 351e Socrates makes the very same claim. However, in the Gorgias at 500d, Socrates refutes Callicles' position, the very one he seemed to agree with in the Protagoras. Moreover, at Protagoras 351c Socrates argues that the good life is one of pleasure while Protagoras suggests that some pleasures are good and others bad; but at Gorgias 492c, 494c, 494e and 497a, Callicles maintains his position that the meaning of life is one of unrestrained pleasure, a notion that Socrates disagrees with and attempts...",You are a university student.

In this assignment, I intend to challenge this notion by not only illustrating examples where significant development occurs after the age of five, but by comparing this knowledge with previous development to discover how far development after five differs from what has gone before. I will do this by exploring three main areas of development: the syntactic development of relative clauses; the cohesive devices used within extended narratives; and the awareness of social roles. Carol Chomsky proposed that the development of syntax fell into two stages: the acquisition of the basic tools of language before five, and the mastering of complex constructions after five years (Karmiloff-Smith 1986). She explains this using the notion of linguistic competence, which is composed of rules that can be applied to the majority of grammatical structures. However, according to Chomsky, complex constructions violate these rules, thus forcing the child to reorganise its internal representations to account for such exceptions. Relative clauses are an example of such...",You are a university student. Write an essay on the topic How Far Does Language After Age Five Differ From What Has Developed Up To That Point?.,,,

The revival of cosmopolitan ideas is connected to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the globalisation of world politics. Globalisation is said to transform loyalties, identities and communities. However, globalisation is a contested phenomenon. The feasibility of the cosmopolitan ideas is seriously questioned if one adopts a more sceptical position. Globalisation may be just a buzzword used by the powerful states to hide selfish interests. In addition, the promotion of a moral universalism is very often criticised as a veil of Westernisation. Whose morality are we to promote globally? Moreover, the cosmopolitan democracy advocated by authors like Held may seem wishful thinking since there is no global 'demos'. First the essay will make a description of the main cosmopolitan ideas and of globalisation's transformative power. The paper will argue that the ethical dilemmas inherent in moral universalism (advocated by cosmopolitanism) are difficult to overcome.

Reasons as to why sense-data theory might be hard to accept and arguments for the proposal of sense-data theory will follow. These arguments supporting sense-data theory arise from hallucination and illusion.

It is important to realise though, that each argument counts equally as much for the other forms of sensory perception, such as aural and tactual perception, as it does for visual perception.

BAWE,BAWE_949,How far can archaeologists reconstruct past social relations using evidence for the disposal of the dead?,"Burial practises have been at the forefront of archaeological discussion for many years. The idea of using burial practices to examine the social relations of the past was long thought to be straight forward; a wealthy grave indicates a chiefdom or stratified society. However, due to the changing ideas presented by recent theories we have now come to look at the evidence in a more open minded way. I will look at how burial is examined; along with ideas about social complexity and to what extent grave goods affect our understanding of status. Historical sources and ethnography will also be used in examining the archaeology. Many early theories such as that of Spencer reduced societies to merely a few categories of complexity, such as band, tribe and state. This often meant huge generalisations were made and whole periods of time were put under one heading. This ignored the inevitable fluctuations and also meant complexity was being directly associated with inequality (Pearson, P 1999. p72).

BAWE,BAWE_444,Japanese Imperialism in East Asia: Obstacle or Facilitator for Contemporary Regional Cooperation?,"<abstract><heading>Abstract</heading>This essay argues that Japanese imperialism was a crucial factor in the history of regional cooperation. Wrenching East Asian nations into modernity via economic development and industrialisation, Japanese imperialism left an indelible imprint on the region which remains to this day. The economic interdependency which emerged prior to the Second World War was subsequently consolidated by the post-bellum foreign policy of the United States in order to promote regional stability. From this, cooperation has developed around a core of economic and production networks. This core of functional interdependency still forms the concrete basis from which regionalism in Pacific Asia is occurring today. Despite a proliferation of potentially divisive issues that have abounded since the turn of the century, economic cooperation provides the impetus for cooperation concerning new and increasingly salient issues which are potentially dangerous conflict ridden. Beginning with locating Japanese imperialism in its historical context, this essay demonstrates that notwithstanding the political and military nature of expansion, the Japanese colonial project had a lasting economic legacy which pervaded the cold-war period and to some extent remains today.

Taylor's rational approach was criticised by the human relation school, and it highlighted that social relationships were a more significant determinant of employee productivity than simply money. There is no more urgent problem than establishing sound and cooperative relations between workers and management (Johnson 1949). Human relations theory (HRT) was generated through a series of experiments and interviews. As Schoen (1957) indicated, similar to the field of medicine, human relations is a field of research, teaching and practice. HRT is regarded having its origin in the Hawthorne studies, in which Mayo was actively involved. Although the methods and findings of this experiment are highly controversial, the significance of the Hawthorne studies is recognized. Firstly, social science is...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_275,Understanding the Dynamics of Political Culture and Regime Stability: Crucial to Achieving Sustainable Political Rule,"Why do some political systems enjoy enduring steadiness, civil order, legitimacy and effectiveness, while others seem perilously fragile? Identifying the causes of regime stability is a central concern for both politicians and political scientists. This is a difficult task, however, as stability is influenced not only by regime type and by the structure of the existing world order, but also by the norms, rules, habits, traditions and belief systems prevailing in a society. These values form a 'political culture' that filters the perceptions of political participants and shapes their behaviour. An unchanging political culture can foster an enduring political situation; accordingly, certain forms of political culture appear to be more conducive to regime constancy than others. There may be a fundamental relationship between political culture and stability. <fnote>Lijphart, Andrew, Democracy in Plural Societies: a Comparative Exploration. London : Yale University Press, 1977, p4 </fnote>An established political culture can enhance the steadiness of a political system primarily because a consistent belief system breeds a consistent political environment.

BAWE,BAWE_947,Were hunters cleverer than scavengers? Discuss in relation to Middle Palaeolithic subsistence strategies.,"To must of us the word scavenging implies an unskilled act carried out by people or animals not clever or organised enough to hunt. However, is this really the case? Examination of the skills required to both hunt and scavenge seems to suggest that both entail similar activities, such as tool making and co-operation. From looking at an array of Middle Palaeolithic sites and their implied subsistence strategies I will assess the extent to which hunting is superior to scavenging, if at all. These sites will include open air sites such as Il'Skaja and Mauren, and rock shelter/cave sites like that at Combe Grenal and Guattari Cave. There are various problems which we will inevitably encounter when trying to evaluate the subsistence strategies of Middle Palaeolithic Neanderthals. For instance, the preservation prospects for plant material are very small so this element is largely missing in the evaluation. Although, bones analysed for isotopes showing the environments lived in show mainly open country animals so meat would have generally been the primary source of protein anyway. Animal bones from the sites may have disappeared post-excavation, and some are more susceptible to decay than others which may cause the data to be skewed....",You are a university student.

It then goes on to discuss their implications for local democracy. <heading>Different Methods of Local Government Revenue Collection</heading><heading>Taxation</heading>Various types of local taxes have been imposed over time. They include rates, the community charge and council tax. Rates were imposed until 1990, and were the main source of local authority revenue dating back to 1601. They were imposed on occupiers of non-agricultural land, domestic dwellings and industrial and commercial properties. Rateable value was usually taken to be the net annual value, being the amount for which the property could be let. Some advantages of rates were that the tax base was certain and the yield was predictable. Taxpayers were used to this tax - the old saying ""an old tax is no tax"" (Harvey and Jowsey, 2004) holds true. The taxing authority was also the spending authority in the area and was accountable to the local electorate. Taxpayers knew in advance what the tax liability in the forthcoming year would be.

BAWE,BAWE_686,Discuss the Main Causes of the 'Urban Riots' in 1980s Britain?,"Britain in the 1980s saw an unprecedented series of increasingly violent urban riots in almost all the major inner-city areas. These were initially met with immense shock from the public and politicians as although Britain has a long history of disorder; from 1945 to 1980 there were 'no riots on British streets' (Benyon and Solomos [eds] 1987). However, by the end of the decade, saturating media coverage and the frequency of urban riots ensured they became a normalized and accepted part of the socio-political climate. This normalisation of British urban disorder in British society continues today with the Bradford riots of 2001 and the Birmingham riots of 2005. From a historical approach, E.P Thompson (in Waddington 1989) argued that collective action was not apolitical but rooted in what he terms the moral economy of the crowd comprising of popular conceptions of justice. Thus for Thompson crowd action is determined by legitimising notions of defending traditional rights and customs. David Waddington (1992) applies this perspective to the study of twentieth-century riots arguing that disorder occurs when the relatively powerless are denied something they feel entitled to.

Is there a link between them?',"The social variables of class and gender are two concepts which are paramount in many of the concerns of today's society. The link of language to class and gender is a common one. Language is a central issue in our lives thus it is natural to link the way we speak to the society we live in. The very things that determine our gender and class are created by the place we live in, the roles that we assume are linked to these social variables. They are socially created. I think that the issue of class and gender can be significantly linked together, particularly if you look at the role of prestige. The way we speak is often linked to prestige through the sound of an accent and the use of standard English. It is thought that those who speak with a higher use of standard English are likely to be of higher class. Assumptions about the way we speak and gender are often made.

Discuss with reference to Mateo Falcone and Tamango.,"As a writer of short stories the author's main objective is to keep the reader interested and to avoid any opportunities for tangent thoughts relating to themes or issues arising from the story. Therefore, the effects of his composition are always in the forefront of Mérimée's mind. The 'nouvelle' is supposed to be read all in one go and Mérimée ensures this possibility using a number of techniques. The first reminder we see in both 'Mateo Falcone' and 'Tamango' of Mérimée's attempt to control the reader is the use of a narrator; the author is not telling the story. The stories are based on a few key events that only take place over a matter of hours or days. The use of a narrator is an important element in Mérimée's composition as it helps to control the reader by distancing them from the characters. This is significant as one of the dangers of a short story is that the reader gets too concerned with characteristics and his attention can be diverted from the narrative. Ergo, Mérimée can, in this way, stay completely objective - neither opinion nor judgement is cast and we, as a reader, are left to make up...",You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_706,Globalisation as a neo-colonial move: A dependency analysis,"<abstract><heading> Abstract </heading>In this paper I argue that the multiple processes of globalisation are regulated and appropriated by the system of transnational capitalism to achieve its stability and growth . The system has a hierarchical structure consisting of a core, semi-periphery and periphery. This hierarchy is essential to the existence and growth of the structure. To maintain this hierarchy the core tries to use every opportunity made available by the processes of globalisation to achieve its maximum growth. However, I apply the theories of dependency to establish that this increasing development of the core involves the increasing underdevelopment and dependency of the semi-periphery and periphery of the system. Thus, I argue that the core uses the processes and forces of globalisation not only to achieve its own growth, but also to ensure that the other two categories maintain their position in the hierarchy. It is in being so regulated by the core of the TCS that globalisation becomes a neo-colonial move. </abstract><heading>Introduction</heading>The term globalisation refers to a multitude of processes that widen and deepen ""the international flows of trade, capital, technology and information within a single integrated global market"" (Petras and Veltmeyer 2001; p. 11).

BAWE,BAWE_464,What lessons should criminal justice and law enforcement learn from the bio-behavioural account of antisocial personality disorder?,"Antisocial personality disorder is also known as psychopathy, sociopathy or dissocial personality disorder. In the 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' or 'DSM-IV', it has been grouped in cluster B of axis II. The manual defines individuals with this disorder as having a tendency to repeatedly break the law without regarding the feelings and rights of people who may become victims of their crimes. DSM-IV includes evidence of impulsiveness in its description, and signs of aggressiveness and lack of empathy. The manual also defines someone with this disorder as being at least eighteen years old and having a history of conduct disorder earlier in life. As a result of their criminal behaviour, many people with antisocial personality disorder end up in prison and there are many questions about how the criminal justice system could better understand these individuals and deal with them in an appropriate way, encouraging them not to re-offend. Some of these questions may be answered by considering the bio-behavioural approach to this disorder.

How do their views, and the differences between them, relate to their distinct historical, religious or intellectual context?","The two men I will be discussing are Aristotle ( 384 - 322 BC) and John Locke ( 1632 - 1704 AD). They were both Empiricists, so they believed that knowledge is gained through experience and formulated their ideas from observation. Great thinkers before them influenced them both, yet both constructed new and refreshing ideas on old beliefs and concepts. Many of these beliefs and ideas they both share are very similar yet there are some distinct differences in they way think. The main similarity is their focus on sensation being the basis for all knowledge. Yet Aristotle furthered this thought by proposing the 'active intellect', suggesting the mind is indeed divine and immortal. Whereas Locke believed cognition began solely with sensation. Aristotle was a true empiricist, gaining all his knowledge from observation; he had no time for the use of experimentation. However he did combine this use of observation with careful reflection and reasoning. When discussing Aristotle it is important to mention that he was the pupil of Plato, which must be considered as a historical and intellectual influence upon his beliefs and ideas.

BAWE,BAWE_508,"In connection with the Second Meditation, Hobbes said it was possible that something that thinks should be something corporeal. Do Descartes' arguments succeed in ruling this possibility out?","Hobbes' claim that it is possible that something that thinks should be something corporeal doesn't carry itself with the same gravitas as Descartes' arguments for the dualism between mind and body. Hobbes' assertion does not imply that the notion of thinking being dependent on a corporeal object should be granted the same amount of acceptance by the common sense of Descartes' day. Instead, Hobbes merely puts forward the possibility that Descartes' arguments in the Second Meditation do not render the position self-contradictory. We will now examine Descartes' arguments in the Second Meditation to see if they hold up to scrutiny. In the third paragraph (J. Cottingham 1996: p.16), while using the method of doubt, Descartes wonders if his existence was bound up with his body and senses. He states that after he has convinced himself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, he still exists because he has convinced himself of something, and in order to convince, one must exist. Although he did not explicitly state it, Descartes has subtly suggested that his existence does not depend on corporeal entities. Moving on, Descartes reiterates his determination to prohibit superfluous properties from being assigned to his identity. He maintains that...","You are a university student.

BAWE,BAWE_293,What do you understand by the term 'charisma'?,"Charisma is perceived by many to simply be the ability to positively influence others by connecting with them physically, emotionally, and intellectually. It is what real leaders have that can inspire you and draw you to them that can cause you to perform beyond expectations to accomplish their goals. In my answer I will be examining the different dimensions to the arguments that intend to investigate the real meaning of charisma, its relevance today and in light of history and different traditions of philosophical thought, what exactly my understanding of the term implies. Though, the understanding of the term charisma can only really be established after placing it within a theoretical and contextual framework. To me this means that inherently charisma is not a concept based solely on the individual characteristics of a person but a phenomenon involving the relationship between a charismatic leader and his or her followers. Probably the most famous and widely used definition of charisma was written by Weber, meaning, 'a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is considered extraordinary and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities.'

BAWE,BAWE_1074,My Dog is a Vegetarian,"<abstract>Dogs evolved from wolves between 15-100,000 years ago. They share similar genes, and anatomical characteristics. Dogs have strong carnassial teeth that shear flesh in a scissor-like fashion, and use powerful muscles to aid in this action. The shape of the dog skull is similar to the omnivorous bear's. Herbivores however, use a developed masseter muscle to masticate plant food in a circular, lateral movement- a procedure that carnivores do not posses. Similarly, carnivores do not have the same microbial activity to efficiently degrade cellulose before absorption, making green plants ineffective in the diet. Carnivores demand a high intake of protein requirement in comparison to herbivorous and omnivorous animals, with essential amino acid deficiencies more common in carnivores. Modern-day dog food consists of a large proportion (50-70%) of carbohydrate, which dogs are able to digest. There is proportionally less protein, and usually comes from cereal and vegetable crops which provide an almost constant nutritional composition allowing the right ratios of essential amino acids to be absorbed, with an excess of limiting amino acids to reduce nutritional protein disorders. Nutrients from meat sources are much lower (~4% minimum) in complete diets, therefore dogs can be healthy with a low meat intake diet....",You are a university student.

During this period there were a number of revolutions, political, cultural and literary. However, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron Shelley and Keats, often referred to as the 'big six' by no means regarded themselves as a unified group and were actually much divided in their political, religious and artistic beliefs. John Blades notes that whilst these recognisable figures of Romantic poetry were aware of each others' work, ""they did not form a recognisable group with anything like a united artistic manifesto."" They did, however, share a strong opposition to the rigid and artificial diction of the Neo-Classical literary movement of the eighteenth century and strove to create poetry which would illustrate ""a natural delineation of human passions, human characters and human incidents."" Politically, the Romantics were against authoritarian government and favoured democracy. They were also attracted to Rousseau and Godwin's campaigns in the cause of humanity.

In general it has been noted that the extent of a language deficit depends on how much the brain has been damaged and the area of damage. Certain theorists claim that particular locations of errors result in specific language deficits such as production and comprehension. I am going to look at whether research into aphasia proves or disproves these claims.

Government policies and targeted funding programmes, as well as employers' calls for an increasingly skilled, knowledgeable and mobile workforce, have promoted lifelong learning to a must status rather than an optional one (Edwards 1997). Benefits of lifelong learning are expounded by governments, policy-makers and adult educators alike (Merrill 2000) and there has been disagreement amongst many regarding the extensive initiatives to promote lifelong learning and ""widen participation"" and the prominent reasons for this ie for economic or social benefits.

The Romantic Movement symbolised a momentous reaction against the degrading material and environmental changes stimulated by the centuries' industrial and agricultural revolutions, alongside a rejection of the rational dogmas of the Enlightenment. The principal characteristics of the Romantic Movement included an overpowering yet troubled love of nature, sympathy and nostalgia for a golden past, and enthusiasm for a simple rural life. A combination of these elements provided the impetus in paving the way for modern environmentalism, because of their connection to the supreme force of Mother Nature and endeavours to protect her dominion. Although it is 'difficult to place the commencement of modern concerns about the environment to any specific date', modern environmentalism evolved as a mass movement since Earth Day, in 1970. Although an understanding of environmental issues had been accumulating throughout the century, this national celebration underlined the fact that modern society was growing increasingly conscious of the threat posed by the profound environmental problems that stemmed from adverse developments in the economy....",You are a university student.
